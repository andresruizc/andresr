These are good activities that we would like to do, but there is a problem.\nWe know we should act, but we find it difficult to do so. It is as if there is an invisible barrier preventing us from moving forward. We are tired, we make excuses, or we doubt ourselves. And that’s a shame, because part of what we achieve in our lives will be due to our actions, not our unfulfilled desires.\nThe fact that there are so many obstacles means that there is no single solution to the problem. But one thing is certain: if you want something to happen, you have to act. If you do nothing, nothing will happen.\nAs the American aviator Elinor Smith said, “Successful people rarely sit back and let things happen. They go out and make things happen.”\nAnd one of the best antidotes to inaction is a sense of urgency that drives you to act.\nHow a sense of urgency will help you break barriers A week before the launch of the first Macintosh, Apple’s engineering team told Steve Jobs that they needed to delay the launch by a week to meet his exacting requirements.\nJobs refused. He told his engineers that if they could do it in two weeks, they could surely do it in one: it made no real difference in such a short time. The original deadline would not be moved. Under no circumstances.\nAt this point, the engineers knew they had to work hard and tackle any problems with determination. But even so, nobody understood what the problem was with delaying the launch by a week.\nUnder such pressure, the engineers might not be able to solve the problems and the launch would go wrong. That would have consequences for Apple’s reputation, and that included Steve Jobs himself. So why the hell take such a risk, and did Jobs have anything to gain by pushing his team so hard?\nIt turns out that Jobs could see something the engineers could not. And there’s a story about Alexander the Great that will help you understand.\nIn the 3rd century BC, dozens of ships from the Macedonian Empire landed on the coast. Led by the legendary Alexander the Great, the Macedonians were about to face the Persian army. The battle was about to begin, but there was one problem: the Macedonians were outnumbered five to one by the Persians. The morale of Alexander’s troops was low, and many even took defeat for granted.\nThen Alexander the Great had an idea that would turn the tide of the battle.\nTo motivate his troops to fight heroically, Alexander had all his own ships burned, leaving his soldiers with only one option to return home: defeat the Persians. They would either win or die. There was no other option. The doubts and fear caused by numerical inferiority were quickly replaced by a strong purpose and desire to win.\nSun Tzu, the legendary Chinese philosopher who wrote The Art of War, when discussing how to keep troops motivated, says: “Bring the troops to a point where they have no way out, so that they must die before they can escape. If they are in grave danger, they will lose their fear. If they have nowhere to go, they will stand firm. If they have no choice, they will fight [to the end].”\nKnown for his cunning and intelligence on the battlefield, Alexander the Great knew how to make the best of unfavourable situations. Against all odds, Macedonia finally defeated the Persians. Alexander the Great’s stratagem of instilling a sense of urgency in his troops made all the difference.\nAnd that is the same sense of urgency that Jobs was trying to instil in his engineers before the presentation.\nWhat Steve Jobs was really trying to do with the Macintosh (and would eventually achieve) was to revolutionise the personal computer industry. That a person would have a computer in their home that they could use for any task.\nAnd such an ambitious and transformative vision requires extreme action.\nJobs knew there were risks in not delaying the launch. But he also knew there was a bigger risk: that his team would not be up to the task of delivering on his vision for the personal computer. That would be a real failure.\nAnd he needed a strong team. The last thing he wanted was for the engineers to become complacent. Or to crumble in the face of a challenge. Or to become unable to solve problems as they arose, to become soft. Or that they wouldn’t have the courage to challenge conventional wisdom. Or that they would lack the confidence and determination to get on with the job.\nSo he decided not to postpone the presentation and pushed them to the limit. A week later, it turned out that the engineers had met the original deadline. The presentation was a success. Like Alexander the Great’s troops, the sense of urgency Jobs instilled in the engineers led them to meet a deadline they thought was unthinkable.\nMany of our first impressions are often based on fear; fear of failure, fear of not meeting expectations, fear of trying to innovate and failing. But such reactions stifle progress.\nTo combat fear, Jobs knew the key was to instill a sense of urgency in what you do. As the Stoic philosopher Seneca once said, “We suffer more in our imagination than in reality”. Steve knew that the solution was not to be paralyzed by these emotions, but to question them and then act. And if it was done with urgency, so much the better.\nAnother innovator who applies this principle is Elon Musk. For Musk, who has revolutionized industries from cars to space rockets, acting with a sense of urgency is key. When Tom Muller, head of SpaceX’s Merlin engine team, presented him with an aggressive timeline for completing a prototype, Elon Musk was not satisfied. He asked that it be cut in half. Mueller, incredulous, told him that such an aggressive schedule could not be reduced any further.\nBut Musk refused. As he often says, “a manic sense of urgency is our operating principle”. And in his view, they weren’t acting with enough of it. Soon after, he stared Mueller in the face and told him that if he wanted to keep his job as head of the engine team, he had to find a way to shorten the timeline. Mueller agreed.\nThe thing is, after working very hard and completing the engine prototype, it turned out that Mueller was right. The schedule that Elon had given us didn’t make sense. It was too aggressive.\nLike Steve Jobs, some of Elon Musk’s deadlines are unrealistic and unreasonable. Does this mean that a sense of urgency is unhelpful? Not at all.\nOne of the reasons SpaceX has been able to revolutionize the aerospace industry is because they use first principles thinking (the only constraints are those dictated by the laws of physics. All the rest are recommendations), coupled with an insane sense of urgency. And that, among other things, makes all the difference in the long run.\nIn fact, as Mueller would later say: “Even though we didn’t meet most of the schedules and cost targets that Elon had set, we outperformed all of our competitors. We were developing the most amazing rockets at the lowest cost in history, and we felt great about it in the end, even if Elon wasn’t happy with us.\nBetween a person with high standards and aggressive deadlines and one with low expectations and no sense of urgency, the former is likely to achieve much more.\nJust as Jobs knew the risk of inaction, Elon Musk believes that inaction can have very negative consequences. He once said, “This is how civilisations decline. They stop taking risks. And when they stop taking risks, their arteries harden. Every year there are more doers and fewer doers. If you’ve been successful for too long, you lose the desire to take risks.”\nSuccess makes you complacent, and that prevents you from taking risks because you think you have more to lose than to gain. The consequence of not taking risks is that you stop acting. And if you don’t act, nothing will happen in the long run. You have to be vigilant. And that requires a strong sense of urgency.\nRevolutionizing the personal computer or the space industry is a bumpy road. Problems crop up all the time. And when problems arise, it is important to act with urgency to solve them as quickly as possible.\nBut we don’t have to be as successful as Steve Jobs or Elon Musk to benefit from acting with urgency. If we don’t act with urgency, we all run the risk of not valuing and appreciating our most precious resource: time. And this is where urgency takes on its true meaning.\nA sense of urgency is key to life In December 1848, Dostoyevsky and his fellow revolutionaries were arrested and imprisoned for their alleged involvement in a conspiracy against the Russian tsar. The punishment in such cases was usually exile for a period of time, but after months in the dungeon the prisoners had no news. One day, without warning, they were taken to a square in St Petersburg. There were many people and soldiers from the Tsar’s army. They had no idea what was happening. They walked on until they saw something that paralyzed them. A scaffold on which a priest and several coffins were being prepared.\nDostoyevsky could not believe it. They had not even been given time to absorb the verdict. They were to be condemned to death and then hanged. Dostoyevsky stood transfixed, staring at what was to be their coffin.\nBut just as the sentence was about to be carried out, a messenger arrived on the square with news. The Tsar had decided to abolish the death penalty. Instead, they were to be sent to Siberia for four years of hard labor.\nIn a letter to his brother the same day, Dostoyevsky said: “When I look back on the past and think how much time I wasted in vain, how much of it was lost in illusions, in mistakes, in idleness, in the inability to live, how I did not value it, […] then my heart shrinks with sorrow. Life is a gift, life is happiness, every moment could have been an eternity of happiness”.\nBeing so close to death was certainly a turning point in Dostoyevsky’s life. This experience helped Dostoyevsky to realize how much time he had lost in the past. It was not that his previous life had been a complete disaster, but that he had lived without realizing something very important: that his time was limited and that one day he would die. And at that moment, the pain of having wasted the past would be transformed into a desire to live life to the full.\nIn other words, Dostoyevsky learned to act with a manic sense of urgency.\nFrom then on, he would write novel after novel at a frenetic pace, eventually publishing Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Kazamagov Brothers, works that would make him one of the greatest writers in history.\nAs Confucius once said, “We have two lives: the second begins when we realize we have only one”.\nConclusion Not everyone is as cunning as Alexander the Great or as wise as Sun Tzu. Not everyone has the ability to build rockets that will take us to Mars.\nBut we can all choose to act with a sense of urgency. Whether it is to achieve more or to learn to value what we have more, we must act.\nWhatever you choose to do, there will always be obstacles. Some will be external, but many will be of your own making. Fear of failure, procrastination, or simply the belief that you have too much time on your hands. If anything, this article should show you the importance of taking action.\nA sense of urgency implies the idea that your time is limited, something we can all understand intellectually but not put into practice. If you live with the idea that one day it will all come to an end, you are likely to enjoy it even more.\nTry the following experiment: For one week, take one activity in your daily life and set yourself unrealistic deadlines. Then act with a manic sense of urgency and be curious to see what happens. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk when it comes to innovation. Like Dostoyevsky after his death.\nIf you do this exercise well, you will most likely fail at what you set out to do. But you will still achieve more than if you had not set aggressive deadlines. This is one of the greatest benefits of acting with a sense of urgency: it helps you break down self-imposed barriers.\n",

<p>At this point, the engineers knew they had to work hard and tackle any problems with determination. But even so, nobody understood what the problem was with delaying the launch by a week.</p>
<p>Under such pressure, the engineers might not be able to solve the problems and the launch would go wrong. That would have consequences for Apple&rsquo;s reputation, and that included Steve Jobs himself. So why the hell take such a risk, and did Jobs have anything to gain by pushing his team so hard?</p>
<p>It turns out that Jobs could see something the engineers could not. And there&rsquo;s a story about Alexander the Great that will help you understand.</p>
<p>In the 3rd century BC, dozens of ships from the Macedonian Empire landed on the coast. Led by the legendary Alexander the Great, the Macedonians were about to face the Persian army. The battle was about to begin, but there was one problem: the Macedonians were outnumbered five to one by the Persians. The morale of Alexander&rsquo;s troops was low, and many even took defeat for granted.</p>
<p>Then Alexander the Great had an idea that would turn the tide of the battle.</p>
<p>To motivate his troops to fight heroically, Alexander had all his own ships burned, leaving his soldiers with only one option to return home: defeat the Persians. They would either win or die. There was no other option. The doubts and fear caused by numerical inferiority were quickly replaced by a strong purpose and desire to win.</p>
<p>Sun Tzu, the legendary Chinese philosopher who wrote The Art of War, when discussing how to keep troops motivated, says: &ldquo;Bring the troops to a point where they have no way out, so that they must die before they can escape. If they are in grave danger, they will lose their fear. If they have nowhere to go, they will stand firm. If they have no choice, they will fight [to the end].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Known for his cunning and intelligence on the battlefield, Alexander the Great knew how to make the best of unfavourable situations. Against all odds, Macedonia finally defeated the Persians. Alexander the Great&rsquo;s stratagem of instilling a sense of urgency in his troops made all the difference.</p>
<p>And that is the same sense of urgency that Jobs was trying to instil in his engineers before the presentation.</p>
<p>What Steve Jobs was really trying to do with the Macintosh (and would eventually achieve) was to revolutionise the personal computer industry. That a person would have a computer in their home that they could use for any task.</p>
<p>And such an ambitious and transformative vision requires extreme action.</p>
<p>Jobs knew there were risks in not delaying the launch. But he also knew there was a bigger risk: that his team would not be up to the task of delivering on his vision for the personal computer. That would be a real failure.</p>
<p>And he needed a strong team. The last thing he wanted was for the engineers to become complacent. Or to crumble in the face of a challenge. Or to become unable to solve problems as they arose, to become soft. Or that they wouldn&rsquo;t have the courage to challenge conventional wisdom. Or that they would lack the confidence and determination to get on with the job.</p>
<p>So he decided not to postpone the presentation and pushed them to the limit. A week later, it turned out that the engineers had met the original deadline. The presentation was a success. Like Alexander the Great&rsquo;s troops, the sense of urgency Jobs instilled in the engineers led them to meet a deadline they thought was unthinkable.</p>
<p>Many of our first impressions are often based on fear; fear of failure, fear of not meeting expectations, fear of trying to innovate and failing. But such reactions stifle progress.</p>
<p>To combat fear, Jobs knew the key was to instill a sense of urgency in what you do. As the Stoic philosopher Seneca once said, &ldquo;We suffer more in our imagination than in reality&rdquo;. Steve knew that the solution was not to be paralyzed by these emotions, but to question them and then act. And if it was done with urgency, so much the better.</p>
<p>Another innovator who applies this principle is Elon Musk. For Musk, who has revolutionized industries from cars to space rockets, acting with a sense of urgency is key. When Tom Muller, head of SpaceX&rsquo;s Merlin engine team, presented him with an aggressive timeline for completing a prototype, Elon Musk was not satisfied. He asked that it be cut in half. Mueller, incredulous, told him that such an aggressive schedule could not be reduced any further.</p>
<p>But Musk refused. As he often says, &ldquo;a manic sense of urgency is our operating principle&rdquo;. And in his view, they weren&rsquo;t acting with enough of it. Soon after, he stared Mueller in the face and told him that if he wanted to keep his job as head of the engine team, he had to find a way to shorten the timeline. Mueller agreed.</p>
<p>The thing is, after working very hard and completing the engine prototype, it turned out that Mueller was right. The schedule that Elon had given us didn&rsquo;t make sense. It was too aggressive.</p>
<p>Like Steve Jobs, some of Elon Musk&rsquo;s deadlines are unrealistic and unreasonable. Does this mean that a sense of urgency is unhelpful? Not at all.</p>
<p>One of the reasons SpaceX has been able to revolutionize the aerospace industry is because they use first principles thinking (the only constraints are those dictated by the laws of physics. All the rest are recommendations), coupled with an insane sense of urgency. And that, among other things, makes all the difference in the long run.</p>
<p>In fact, as Mueller would later say: &ldquo;Even though we didn&rsquo;t meet most of the schedules and cost targets that Elon had set, we outperformed all of our competitors. We were developing the most amazing rockets at the lowest cost in history, and we felt great about it in the end, even if Elon wasn&rsquo;t happy with us.</p>
<p>Between a person with high standards and aggressive deadlines and one with low expectations and no sense of urgency, the former is likely to achieve much more.</p>
<p>Just as Jobs knew the risk of inaction, Elon Musk believes that inaction can have very negative consequences. He once said, &ldquo;This is how civilisations decline. They stop taking risks. And when they stop taking risks, their arteries harden. Every year there are more doers and fewer doers. If you&rsquo;ve been successful for too long, you lose the desire to take risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Success makes you complacent, and that prevents you from taking risks because you think you have more to lose than to gain. The consequence of not taking risks is that you stop acting. And if you don&rsquo;t act, nothing will happen in the long run. You have to be vigilant. And that requires a strong sense of urgency.</p>
<p>Revolutionizing the personal computer or the space industry is a bumpy road. Problems crop up all the time. And when problems arise, it is important to act with urgency to solve them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have to be as successful as Steve Jobs or Elon Musk to benefit from acting with urgency. If we don&rsquo;t act with urgency, we all run the risk of not valuing and appreciating our most precious resource: time. And this is where urgency takes on its true meaning.</p>

<p>In December 1848, Dostoyevsky and his fellow revolutionaries were arrested and imprisoned for their alleged involvement in a conspiracy against the Russian tsar. The punishment in such cases was usually exile for a period of time, but after months in the dungeon the prisoners had no news. One day, without warning, they were taken to a square in St Petersburg. There were many people and soldiers from the Tsar&rsquo;s army. They had no idea what was happening. They walked on until they saw something that paralyzed them. A scaffold on which a priest and several coffins were being prepared.</p>
<p>Dostoyevsky could not believe it. They had not even been given time to absorb the verdict. They were to be condemned to death and then hanged. Dostoyevsky stood transfixed, staring at what was to be their coffin.</p>
<p>But just as the sentence was about to be carried out, a messenger arrived on the square with news. The Tsar had decided to abolish the death penalty. Instead, they were to be sent to Siberia for four years of hard labor.</p>
<p>In a letter to his brother the same day, Dostoyevsky said: &ldquo;When I look back on the past and think how much time I wasted in vain, how much of it was lost in illusions, in mistakes, in idleness, in the inability to live, how I did not value it, [&hellip;] then my heart shrinks with sorrow. Life is a gift, life is happiness, every moment could have been an eternity of happiness&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Being so close to death was certainly a turning point in Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s life. This experience helped Dostoyevsky to realize how much time he had lost in the past. It was not that his previous life had been a complete disaster, but that he had lived without realizing something very important: that his time was limited and that one day he would die. And at that moment, the pain of having wasted the past would be transformed into a desire to live life to the full.</p>
<p>In other words, Dostoyevsky learned to act with a manic sense of urgency.</p>
<p>From then on, he would write novel after novel at a frenetic pace, eventually publishing Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Kazamagov Brothers, works that would make him one of the greatest writers in history.</p>
<p>As Confucius once said, &ldquo;We have two lives: the second begins when we realize we have only one&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h3>
<p>Not everyone is as cunning as Alexander the Great or as wise as Sun Tzu. Not everyone has the ability to build rockets that will take us to Mars.</p>
<p>But we can all choose to act with a sense of urgency. Whether it is to achieve more or to learn to value what we have more, we must act.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose to do, there will always be obstacles. Some will be external, but many will be of your own making. Fear of failure, procrastination, or simply the belief that you have too much time on your hands. If anything, this article should show you the importance of taking action.</p>
<p>A sense of urgency implies the idea that your time is limited, something we can all understand intellectually but not put into practice. If you live with the idea that one day it will all come to an end, you are likely to enjoy it even more.</p>
<p>Try the following experiment: For one week, take one activity in your daily life and set yourself unrealistic deadlines. Then act with a manic sense of urgency and be curious to see what happens. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk when it comes to innovation. Like Dostoyevsky after his death.</p>
<p>If you do this exercise well, you will most likely fail at what you set out to do. But you will still achieve more than if you had not set aggressive deadlines. This is one of the greatest benefits of acting with a sense of urgency: it helps you break down self-imposed barriers.</p>
