One day in the institute, she met Calvin Harris, one of the most acclaimed scientists in the world. Harris, who also had a terrible childhood, was intelligent and kind. He always supported Elizabeth. They spent much time together, sharing many ideas and collaborating on research projects. It was the first time she felt deeply understood in a very long time. Both quickly fell in love.

In addition, she was fired and started to run out of money. Few people supported her. Everything turned dark, but giving up was not in Elizabeth’s nature. Her daughter, Mad, and her love for chemistry would save her. And cooking. Elizabeth was interested in cooking because she believed it was the same as chemistry. So, she did what creative and innovative people do: seeing ideas nobody can and then combining them in unexpected ways, creating original ideas. She intensely focused on chemistry and cooking, using unexplored techniques that gave rise to recipes never seen before.\nA friend of hers, who worked at TV, offered Elizabeth to host a cooking show: Supper at six. She would cook one meal daily and discuss the importance of eating healthily. Elizabeth didn’t like the idea but needed money, so she accepted. At first, the show was not going well and was close to getting canceled. But people started loving the recipes and the originality of Elizabeth, whose recipes and analogies between chemistry and cooking blew the audience’s minds. Against all odds, the show became a national success, and Elizabeth was deeply admired. She would occasionally send encouraging messages to the audience. One day, she said:\n“Whenever you start doubting yourself or feeling afraid, just remember. Courage is the root of change, and change is what we’re chemically designed to do. So when you wake up tomorrow, make this pledge. No more holding yourself back. No more subscribing to other’s opinions of what you can and cannot achieve. And no more allowing anyone to pigeonhole you into useless categories of sex, race, economic status, and religion. Do not allow your talents to lie dormant, ladies. Design your own future. When you go home today, ask yourself what you will change. And then get started.”\nWhen we feel inspired by someone, it is not because of what they do or how they do it. It’s because of why they do it. Elizabeth was excellent at cooking and used innovative techniques, but the most important thing was the principles and values she embodied. She didn’t accept the status quo, rejecting and challenging all preconceived notions about what women could do. Elizabeth believed that there is hidden potential inside every person, and she used cooking to help people discover how to unleash it. Elizabeth experienced many setbacks throughout her life but didn’t get stuck in the past. That’s what all her audience saw, making Elizabeth so admired. She knew it was not what happens to you that matters but your reaction to these experiences. That means the key is your willingness to embrace and adopt change and get started, no matter what.\n“Design your own future. When you go home today, ask yourself what you will change. And then get started.” ~Elizabett Zoth, Lessons in Chemistry.\n",
