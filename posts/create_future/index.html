It wasn’t that she didn’t enjoy learning. She loved it. But all learning there was based on memorization, and Elizabeth liked creativity. Elizabeth also disliked her classmates, with whom they shared no hobbies. And all that made her suffer. A lot. She was a ten-year-old girl, and everything was supposed to be fun. But it wasn’t. She hated school, had no friends, and never had the feeling of fitting in.\nThe nightmare didn’t end when school was over and she came back home. Her parents, especially her father, were not nice to Elizabeth. But there was always a glimmer of hope: her older brother John. John represented the opposite of what she didn’t like about her life. John was always there, always kind and protective and encouraging Elizabeth to question things and learn by oneself.\nTheir relationship was amazing, and as they spent more time together, grew stronger and stronger. Elizabeth had the feeling that everything could go terrible, but if John was by her side, things would somehow work out well. And then everything changed.\nElizabeth’s father was extremely intolerant of people who were different from him, and when he found out that his son John was gay, he harassed him. For him, having a gay son was a disgrace, and therefore decided to make his life impossible. Since then, John felt imprisoned, as if there came a day when John decided it was time to put an end to it. He committed suicide. When Elizabeth found out, she was alone and devastated. She felt hopeless, convinced there was nothing she could do to improve her life, and all she could see was darkness.\nA couple of years laters, as he approached her entry into university, she realized she liked science because it provided her certainties. And more specifically, chemistry. Atoms and chemical reactions were easier to understand than people. But it was in the 50s, and women were not considered good enough. Women were, mostly, homeworkers and secretaries, and not scientists, engineers, or pilots.\nShe graduated with honors with a bachelor’s and master’s degree, and decided to pursue a Ph.D. But soon after starting, her tutor tried to sexually abuse her, and since the professor was very influential and the women were treated unfairly, there was not even a trial. Elizabeth was forced to leave her university, dropping out from her PhD. She looked for different PhD programs but found none. The only way for her to do science was to join an institute that offered an assistant job called Hastings, in which she would work in a lab together with scientists.\nThe conditions were far from ideal. She was not treated well at her new job and had to fight for everything, but at least people let her work on science, her passion. One day, while eating lunch at the cafeteria, she met Calvin Harris, one of the most acclaimed scientists in the world. Both quickly became friends. Harris, who also had a terrible childhood, was intelligent and kind. He always supported Elizabeth, like her older brother John. They spent much time together, sharing many ideas and collaborating on research projects. It was the first time she felt deeply understood in a very long time. Both quickly fell in love. She was happy. But one day, everything changed.\nHarris died in an accident, leaving her alone and devastated. Hastings removed everything related to Harris’, including his lab team and funding. And since Elizabeth depended on Harris, she was fired. Elizabeth tried to unsuccessfully find a new job, and as a result money was running out. She discovered she was pregnant and would soon be a single mother. Everything turned dark, but giving up was not in Elizabeth’s nature. Her daughter, Mad, and her love for chemistry would save her. And also cooking, which she was always interested in because she believed it was the same as chemistry. With no job and with a lot of free time, she did what different and innovative people do: to combine unrelated ideas in unexpected and never seen ways, giving rise to original creations. Using unexplored techniques together with her in depth knowledge in chemistry, she created new recipes never seen before.\nAfter catching the attention of a friend of hers, who worked as TV director, Elizabethwas offered to host a cooking show: Supper at six. She would cook one meal daily and discuss the importance of eating healthily, with potentially millions of people watching. Elizabeth didn’t like the idea but needed money, so she accepted. When she was in school, nobody knew her. Now, things were different. At first, the show was not going well and was close to getting canceled. But people started loving the originality of Elizabeth, whose recipes and analogies between chemistry and cooking blew the audience’s minds.\nAgainst all odds, the show became a national success, and Elizabeth was deeply admired. However, after several successful years, Elizabeth decided to cancel the show, because she never intended to be a national TV star. All she wanted was to do science, her true passion. Elizabeth would occasionally send encouraging messages to the audience, and on the last day of the show, she sent a special one, especially dedicated to all women across the country:\nWhenever you start doubting yourself or feeling afraid, just remember. Courage is the root of change, and change is what we’re chemically designed to do. So when you wake up tomorrow, make this pledge. No more holding yourself back. No more subscribing to other’s opinions of what you can and cannot achieve. And no more allowing anyone to pigeonhole you into useless categories of sex, race, economic status, and religion. Do not allow your talents to lie dormant, ladies. Design your own future. When you go home today, ask yourself what you will change. And then get started.\nWhen we feel inspired by someone, it is not because of what they do or how they do it. It’s because of why they do it. Elizabeth was excellent at cooking and used innovative techniques, but the most important thing was the principles and values she embodied. She didn’t accept the status quo, rejecting and challenging all preconceived notions about what women could do. Elizabeth believed that there is hidden potential inside every person, and she used cooking to help people discover how to unleash it. Elizabeth experienced many setbacks throughout her life but didn’t get stuck in the past. That’s what all her audience saw, making Elizabeth so admired. She knew it was not what happens to you that matters but your reaction to these experiences. That means the key is your willingness to embrace and adopt change and get started, no matter what.\n“Design your own future. When you go home today, ask yourself what you will change. And then get started.” ~Elizabett Zoth, Lessons in Chemistry.\n",
