Truly being ready means understanding what could go wrong – and having a plan to deal with it.”\n_ Chris Hadfield, An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth _\nEliud Kipchoge is considered the greatest marathon runner of all time. As with the most iconic athletes, the principles and values they embody are far more relevant than their achievements. In a speech at the Oxford Union in early 2018, Kipchoge said, “I believe in a philosophy that says to win is not important. To be successful is not even important. How to plan and prepare is critical and crucial. When you plan very well, then success can come on your way. Then winning can come on your way.”\nIt’s natural to feel inspired by him, but how can we prepare and become more competent? It depends on what we want to accomplish, but we can follow some general guidelines. In this post, we will explore the practice of thinking negatively.\nThink negatively\nIn his book, An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, retired NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield explains that one of the best ways to prepare is to practice “The power of negative thinking.”\nAs he mentions in his book from his training program at NASA, “trainers in the space program specialize in devising bad-news scenarios for us to act out, over and over again, in increasingly elaborate simulations. We practice what we’ll do if there’s engine trouble, a computer meltdown, an explosion.” These simulations play a significant role in Chris Hadfield’s understanding of competence. He continues, “Being forced to confront the prospect of failure head-on-to study it, dissect it, tease apart all its components and consequences- really works. After a few years of doing that pretty much daily, you’ve forged the strongest possible armor to defend against fear: hard-won competence.”\nWhen the stakes are high, as with space exploration, nothing can be left to chance—every detail matters because the mission’s success and the astronaut’s survival depends on it—and these simulations made astronauts more competent.\nOne could argue that these simulations are not critical for competence because reality is very complex, and sooner than later, unexpected things happen. If that’s the case, what’s the point of devising bad news scenarios? The key is to see beyond the simulations themselves. The most interesting lesson was not about learning to deal with a computer meltdown or an explosion (which, by the way, was extremely important because it could be lifesaving) but the process that came after that.\nOnce the simulations were carried out, astronauts could analyze their decisions, listen to feedback, and look for areas of improvement. Maybe they performed poorly under pressure, or the crew could have cooperated more efficiently. Or perhaps these simulations made astronauts realize that making good decisions with limited information in a hostile environment is highly complicated. These lessons could be the key to competence; they apply to a specific-given simulation, and any challenge astronauts may encounter during their future missions. When the unexpected happens, not only in space exploration but also in life, knowing how to thrive under pressure or make good decisions with uncertainty could make a difference.\nWhen SpaceX, in partnership with NASA, was about to launch astronauts to the ISS for the first time, Elon Musk and NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine gave a short interview. When Elon was asked about the most challenging part of transitioning from cargo to crew, he said, “I told the SpaceX team that the mission reliability is the main priority right now … we’re just doing continuous ensuring reviews from now, nonstop, 24 hours a day until launch … we’re just looking for any possible action that could improve the probability of success no matter how small.” This obsession for detail is what it often takes to achieve competence and is also what NASA trainers were looking for when making up simulations for astronauts.\nThe practice of negative thinking is not specific to space exploration. For Marcus Aurelius, being a roman emperor was not easy. He faced war, disease, and even a full-scale civil war. In addition, he was surrounded by senators and military members who didn’t share his values, didn’t want him as emperor, and even wanted him dead.\nIn his Meditations, he tells himself: “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil … And so, none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative or hate him.”\nNothing was more important for Marcus Aurelius than what the stoics call the four virtues: courage, discipline, wisdom, and temperance. In the face of chaos, it is straightforward to be carried away by negative emotions and respond irrationally. By planning his day and recognizing the problematic people he would encounter, he was in a better mindset to react rationally and calmly. He practiced negative visualization not because he was pessimistic but because he wanted to be better prepared for difficult situations.\nThe power of thinking negatively: a real-world example\nConsider a non-experienced runner training for a marathon. Marathons are demanding, both physically and mentally. They require mental toughness, discipline, good physical health, and hours and hours of training. Injuries are one of the most common drawbacks when training for a marathon; no one is immune to them.\nHow can we think negatively to avoid getting an injury? Before starting your training regime, consider the possibility of you getting injured. Assume the usual thing is to get hurt somewhere along the way, not the opposite. And once you have visualized how things could go wrong, act out and try to prevent them. To do so, you could start with the following questions:\n• What are the most common injuries among marathon runners?\n• What are some leading causes of injuries, and how can they be avoided?\n• How can we reduce the probability of getting injured?\n• What will you do if you get injured?\nAnd then, act. Study the most common injuries among marathon runners: shin splints, back pain, stress fractures, or runner’s knee. Second, try to understand why they happen; they may be due to a combination of different factors: improper running technique, lack of body mobility, insufficient muscle mass, inadequate running shoes, or overtraining, among others. Then, work on them one by one:\n• Add strengthening exercises to your routine to become stronger.\n• Add mobility and stretching exercises.\n• Schedule your workouts, leaving time to rest\n• Sleep well and eat healthily.\n• Make sure your running shoes are adequate.\n• Improve your running technique.\nYou may follow these rules and get injured, or not follow them and run a marathon injury-free. Does it mean you wasted your time? Not really. We can never be sure what will happen; some things remain outside our control. If you acted in a way that helped you move in the right direction, it’s okay.\nConclusion\nSometimes visualizing how things could go wrong is complicated: we may feel fear, lack imagination, or prefer to assume things will always go our way. Don’t let all that stop you! The lessons you can learn from visualizing negative scenarios are definitively worth the effort. If astronauts, a roman emperor, or athletes can benefit from devising bad news scenarios and acting out, then the rest of us can. We all have room for improvement, and if there is something we can learn from these examples is that we are only limited by our willingness to improve.\n",

<p>Eliud Kipchoge is considered the greatest marathon runner of all time. As with the most iconic athletes, the principles and values they embody are far more relevant than their achievements.
