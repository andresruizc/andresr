  "articleBody": "At the age of thirteen, Bruce Lee discovered his true passion: martial arts. He practiced every day, all the time. He was so talented, skilled, hard-working and driven. No one doubted he would be unstoppable. He devoted himself body and soul to the discipline. But there was a problem.\nFrom time to time, Yip Man, his teacher, tried to teach him key ideas: “Never impose yourself on nature. It flows”, “never oppose any problem head on, but counter it by balancing with it.”\nBut Bruce did not understand these messages. Nor did they interest him. All the young Bruce Lee wanted was to practice, practice, practice. To punch, to move, to jump. Non-stop. The more the better. There was no time for philosophical ideas.\nYip Man was alarmed. Yes, his ideas were profound. But they hid the essence of the martial arts. Without mastering them, Bruce would not get very far. So he changed his strategy. He told Bruce Lee that for a week there would be no training. But he gave him a task: he had to reflect and try to understand his abstract teachings.\nBruce went ballistic. Asking him to rest was like telling a person not to breathe. Bruce, whose nickname was “Never Sit Still”, thought that missing a week of training would make him worse. Working hard, and not resting, is what would get him to the top.\nAt first Bruce resisted, but soon after he agreed. And what he learned next would change his life forever.\nAgitated and angry, Bruce decided to take a boat and go paddling on a lake. After a while, he decided to lie down and reflect on Yip Man’s teachings. Finding no solution, he became so frustrated that he started punching the water with all his might. At that moment, he became paralyzed. A thought came to him. He had just understood the teachings of his master.\nAs Bruce Lee said in his essays:\nHadn’t this water illustrated to me the principle of gung fu? I hit it, but it did not suffer any damage.I struck it again with all my might, but it was not hurt. […] This water, the softest substance in the world, which could be contained in the smallest bottle, seemed only weak. In reality, it could penetrate the hardest substances in the world. That was it! Yip wanted it to be like the nature of water.\nThe idea about the nature of water would become a key element for Bruce Lee, both in the martial arts and in his philosophy of life. One of his most important lemmas is “Be Water, My Friend”.\nEmpty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.\nTo take a step forward, maybe you need to take two steps backwards When we really like something it is very easy to become obsessed with it. We adopt an all-or-nothing mentality, forgetting that there are always nuances. Either I’m working directly towards my goal, or I’m wasting my time.\nBut it doesn’t have to be like that. Bruce Lee had his epiphany with water when he stopped his training and spent time doing nothing. Without that moment, Bruce Lee might never have become who he was.\nThere are times when it is necessary to take a step back in order to take two steps forward. If you are an artist, passive activities such as walking will enhance your creativity. Beethoven carried his scores with him on his walks. Nietzsche said, “Only ideas gained by walking are of any value”.\nProcrastination can be productive. At the end of a day’s work writing a film script, Quentin Tarantino goes to his swimming pool and floats. This moment is crucial to his creativity, as it helps him to absorb the ideas he has worked on during the day and generate new ones to work on the next day.\nEinstein played the violin when he got stuck solving a complicated physics problem. When Andrew Wiles got stuck trying to solve Fermat’s Theorem, he would go for walks to relax and let his subconscious mind work on the problem.\nThere is a very famous saying commonly attributed to Navy SEALs that refers to firing a weapon. “Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.” Trying to go too fast can jam the mechanism, making it impossible to fire. But if you do things carefully and in a timely manner, everything will run smoothly and the gun will fire.\nAs the psychologist and researcher Amos Tversky said: the secret to doing good research is to always be a little underemployed. Years are wasted because you can’t waste hours.\nSometimes you have to take a step back to take two steps forward.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>At the age of thirteen, Bruce Lee discovered his true passion: martial arts. He practiced every day, all the time. He was so talented, skilled, hard-working and driven. No one doubted he would be unstoppable. He devoted himself body and soul to the discipline. But there was a problem.</p>
<p>From time to time, Yip Man, his teacher, tried to teach him key ideas: &ldquo;Never impose yourself on nature. It flows&rdquo;, &ldquo;never oppose any problem head on, but counter it by balancing with it.&rdquo;</p>
