  "articleBody": "A lot of people find writing difficult. I think so too. When I first started writing, there wasn’t a day that went by that I didn’t end up frustrated. When I tried to articulate an idea, I couldn’t find the words. Often I had no idea what I was writing about. It still happens.\nWhen I was really frustrated and wanted to give up, I thought the main problem was that writing was complicated. My frustration was justified, I thought, and the only solution was to improve my writing skills.\nBut then I read something that changed my perspective.\nEmotional control is key to mastery In his book An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, Chris Hadfield talks about how hard it is to become an astronaut. He says that you can be the most talented person in the world, but you won’t become an astronaut if you lack certain skills, such as “the ability to push yourself to the point of discomfort and beyond”.\nIf becoming an astronaut, one of the most complicated jobs there is, requires skills like hard work, what role can those skills play in writing? Can I be good at writing if I don’t know how to push myself to the point of discomfort or be disciplined?\nIn his book Mastery, Robert Greene explores what it takes to achieve mastery in any field, using the examples of Einstein, Da Vinci, Marie Curie and many others. And he explains something that I don’t think we pay enough attention to.\nWhat separates masters from others is often something surprisingly simple. Whenever we learn a skill, we often feel frustrated; what we are learning seems beyond our capabilities. By giving in to these feelings, we unconsciously give up on ourselves before we really give up.\nThe only real impediment to mastery is yourself and your emotions - boredom, panic, frustration, insecurity. You cannot suppress such emotions; they are normal to the process and are experienced by everyone, including Masters. What you can do is have faith in the process.\nWhen we face a difficult problem, our enemy is not only the problem itself, but also our attitude. And this is interesting because it is often we ourselves who make things more difficult.\nImagine you are trapped in a maze and you want to get out. You will try different ways and it is normal not to find the way out at first. When this happens you will feel frustration, panic and even fear. This is normal. But the important thing is how you react.\nYou can see your mistakes as a sign that you are unable to get out of the maze. If you let frustration and panic take over, it will be harder to get out of the maze.\nOr you can look at your mistakes as something positive. You try to reason and realise that you haven’t reached the exit, but you’ve found a way that doesn’t work. Now you are closer to finding the exit because you know the maze better. You still feel difficult emotions, but you don’t let them cloud your judgement. You don’t want to give up, you want to keep trying.\nWhat role does emotional control play in finding the solution? This is hard to quantify. It is clear that emotional control alone is not enough to get out of the maze. You need knowledge, but with poor emotional control, getting out of the maze is much more complicated.\nSimilarly, when we reach our limit, how do we know whether it is the difficulty of the problem, our attitude, or a combination of both? It is very difficult to know; it is a question only you can answer for yourself. But it is clear that the way you react to a problem determines to some extent its difficulty.\nWriting is difficult. But when I encounter problems, if my attitude isn’t right, I make the situation worse. I make writing more difficult.\nWhen frustration sets in, I can take it as a sign that I have no idea how to write, so I give up. Or I can see frustration as a sign that I’m doing something complex, because otherwise I wouldn’t be frustrated. And I can see that if I can keep going, I will improve as a writer.\nThe meaning you give to your emotions is up to you. You can make them your friend or your enemy.\nAnd that is the key, because behind extraordinary achievements lies inhuman emotional control.\nHow the best athletes control their emotions Eliud Kipchoge is the greatest marathon runner of all time. Of the 21 marathons he has run, Kipchoge has won 18, including two Olympic gold medals. It takes more than exceptional fitness to achieve this feat. You also have to have exceptional emotional control. Others may run away from difficult situations like boredom or frustration, but athletes like Kipchoge can’t afford to do that. And the following story illustrates this.\nAfter winning gold in the marathon at the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games, Kipchoge and several other runners were waiting in a hall to collect their medals.\nBut organizational problems meant they had to wait for hours. Tired after the marathon, there was not much to do in the room. Bored, most of the runners did the usual thing: they looked for distractions. They took out their smartphones and spent their time surfing the internet or social media.\nAll except one. Kipchoge.\nKipchoge stood silently, waiting patiently for his medal. The rest of the runners escaped boredom, but not Kipchoge. As one of the runners in the room later joked, “Kipchoge is not human.\nIt’s impossible to win a marathon at such a high level and not feel incredible pain at some point during the race. Or doubt yourself when you know you are the greatest marathoner of all time and everyone is watching. Or feeling pressure. Or the weight of high expectations.\nThese are defining moments, and good emotional control is key to keeping them in check. After all, you can’t be emotionally strong and win 18 out of 21 marathons.\nNovak Djokovic, the most decorated tennis player of all time, also knows the importance of emotions in performing at the highest level. He recently became the player with the most Grand Slams in history and reached 400 weeks at number one. Such consistency was unthinkable in a sport as demanding as tennis until he achieved it. He doesn’t just break records. He creates new ones.Asked in a recent interview about the secret to his mental toughness, Djokovic said:\nProbably one of the biggest lessons I’ve learnt about mental toughness is that if you lose focus because things start to go wrong for you, that’s OK. Accept it and come back to the present moment. How you bounce back is the most important thing.\nI think what separates you from other people is how long you stay in that negative emotional state. Because it’s almost impossible to stay in the present moment all the time. We’re always thinking about what’s going to happen, how I’m going to win or whatever. But the speed with which you recover from a loss of concentration and come back to the present is one of the most important ingredients of mental toughness.\nIt’s not about a spectacular backhand or a spectacular serve, it’s about the ability to come back to the present moment, to calm your mind and play your best.\nConclusion No matter who you are or what you do, there will always be someone you have to beat. It’s you. The enemy is not only outside, but also inside you.\nDifficult emotions will always arise. They cannot be avoided. But what you can do is learn to deal with them. We are all likely to be limited more by a lack of emotional control than by the difficulty of the problem we face, so the ability to prevent your emotions from overwhelming or derailing you is one of the factors that can help you excel the most.\nThe enemy is both outside and within you. Control your emotions.\n",

<p>These are defining moments, and good emotional control is key to keeping them in check. After all, you can&rsquo;t be emotionally strong and win 18 out of 21 marathons.</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic, the most decorated tennis player of all time, also knows the importance of emotions in performing at the highest level. He recently became the player with the most Grand Slams in history and reached 400 weeks at number one. Such consistency was unthinkable in a sport as demanding as tennis until he achieved it. He doesn&rsquo;t just break records. He creates new ones.Asked in a recent interview about the secret to his mental toughness, Djokovic said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably one of the biggest lessons I&rsquo;ve learnt about mental toughness is that if you lose focus because things start to go wrong for you, that&rsquo;s OK. Accept it and come back to the present moment. How you bounce back is the most important thing.</p>
<p>I think what separates you from other people is how long you stay in that negative emotional state. Because it&rsquo;s almost impossible to stay in the present moment all the time. We&rsquo;re always thinking about what&rsquo;s going to happen, how I&rsquo;m going to win or whatever. But the speed with which you recover from a loss of concentration and come back to the present is one of the most important ingredients of mental toughness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about a spectacular backhand or a spectacular serve, it&rsquo;s about the ability to come back to the present moment, to calm your mind and play your best.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h3>
<p>No matter who you are or what you do, there will always be someone you have to beat. It&rsquo;s you. The enemy is not only outside, but also inside you.</p>
<p>Difficult emotions will always arise. They cannot be avoided. But what you can do is learn to deal with them. We are all likely to be limited more by a lack of emotional control than by the difficulty of the problem we face, so the ability to prevent your emotions from overwhelming or derailing you is one of the factors that can help you excel the most.</p>
<p>The enemy is both outside and within you. Control your emotions.</p>
