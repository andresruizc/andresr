      <description>In 1914, Ernest Shackleton chose one of the most audacious goals at that time: make the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent. It was inconceivable that a group of people could do that. And they failed, but are not remembered as a failure—quite the opposite.
Just a couple of months after their departure, Shackleton&amp;rsquo;s trip, the Endurance, became trapped in ice and eventually sank. They spent several months in the harsh Antarctic, isolated from human civilization, trying to survive under extreme conditions with temperatures reaching minus 40º and winds reaching up to 200 km/h.</description>

      <title>Why I take cold showers</title>

      <description>Do difficult things every day. Step out of your comfort zone daily because that will callous your mind. Sounds good, so I researched cold showers and discovered they have been shown to have several benefits, including reduced inflammation, reduced stress levels, boosted energy, increased immunity, and enhanced focus, among others. And because I considered them as self-imposed torture, I decided to take cold showers every morning. Then, everything went differently than planned.</description>

      <description>NOTE : This tutorial is a personal wrap-up of the TFX Pipeline Tutorial using the Penguin Dataset. The code used is identical, but I have added an introduction to TFX and several explanations for every section. The goal of this post to document my learning notes about TFX.
What is TFX, and why is needed?
Machine Learning is more than getting data, training models, and making predictions. A wide range of constraints and requirements need to be addressed for ML to add value in the real world:</description>

      <title>Retrieval stage recommender systems with TensorFlow</title>

      <description>Introduction to recommender systems Some of the most exciting features that big companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify offer rely on recommender systems. Much useful information can be collected whenever users navigate the Amazon website, listen to a playlist on Spotify, or scroll through the Netflix catalog. This data includes user behavior, item attributes, or interactions between users and is what machine learning recommender systems use to make personalized recommendations.</description>

      <description>You who are passing by
I beg you
Do something
Learn a dance step
Something to justify your existence
Something that gives you the right
To be dressed in your skin in your body
Learn to walk and to laugh
Because it would be too senseless
After all
For many to have died
While you live
Doing nothing with your life

      <description>Feeling ready to do something does not mean feeling certain that you&amp;rsquo;ll succeed, though of course that&amp;rsquo;s what you are hoping to do. Truly being ready means understanding what could go wrong – and having a plan to deal with it.

Eliud Kipchoge is considered the greatest marathon runner of all time. As with the most iconic athletes, the principles and values they embody are far more relevant than their achievements.</description>
