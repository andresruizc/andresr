Then, everything went differently than planned.\nThe first cold showers were manageable, but after a few days, they were getting progressively hotter and shorter. Mental discomfort increased, and the initial excitement I felt after discovering the benefits of cold showers morphed into self-doubt. My list of excuses to give up piled up, and as usually happens when creating new habits, I was about to quit. The cold shower of the next day would be the last.\nReaching our limit is not some kind of punishment. It’s actually a sign of health that, when we meet the place where we are about to die, we feel fear and trembling. A further sign of health is that we don’t become undone by fear and trembling, but we take it as a message that it’s time to stop struggling and look directly at what’s threatening us. Things like disappointment and anxiety are messengers telling us that we’re about to go into unknown territory.\nPema Chödron, When Things Fall Apart\nI would define my experience before the cold shower as a state of agitation that biased me toward inaction through excuses, self-doubt, anxiety, and procrastination. A voice that prevented me from behaving differently, which is not specific to cold showers at all. It also appears when you decide to take on a new challenge but wonder if it is too audacious, when you need to work hard on a project and don’t feel like it, or when you consider asking someone out and fear of rejection stops you. So, you’d better learn to deal with it.\nSteven Pressfield, author of The War of Art, gives that voice a name: Resistance. He defines it as a force within you that manifests as excuses, procrastination, doubts, uncertainty, dramatization, fear, or ego. How it manifests is different for every person. For Pressfield, Resistance is “a voice in my head telling me why I can’t do something or why I should put it off for another day.”\nResistance will prevent you from showing up as your best self. From working on a personal project. From taking risks. According to Pressfield, Resistance is your greatest enemy, and the difference between amateurs and professionals often boils down to beating it.\nLet’s explore two ways Resistance beats you: fear of failure and inaction.\nInaction may seem the best solution to some problems, but it has a hidden cost. As Jordan Peterson told Chris Williamson in a podcast, “The _thing about inaction is that you are blind to it. Do not make the assumption that inaction has no price.”\nDeeply influenced by Zen Buddhism, Steve Jobs knew that most first impressions were rooted in fear. He understood the devasting consequences of letting fear stop you and that inaction is far more dangerous than failure or rejection. As he said in an interview:\n“Most people never pick up the phone. Most people never call and ask. And that’s what separates sometimes the people who do things from those who just dream about them. You have to act. You have to be willing to fail. You have to be willing to crash and burn. With people on the phone or starting a company, if you’re afraid you’ll fail, you won’t get very far.”\nFear of failure leads to inaction. If you want to avoid failure, then doing nothing is fine. You may start doing something, and as soon as uncertainty or doubts appear, you give up because that means you have achieved your goal of avoiding failure. Or better, you never start. But inaction has a hidden cost. Doing nothing …\nAcknowledging that inaction and fear of failure have negative consequences is a good first step, but that knowledge is not enough to beat Resistance. We need something more. We need to encounter that voice every day, and this is where cold showers help. As you may have guessed by now, this is not about cold showers. Cold showers are just a means to meet Resistance.\nWhen Resistance appears before and during the cold shower, it’s all about observing. Your thoughts, your reactions, and how you deal with the situation. Some days I complain, argue that it doesn’t make sense, or get paralyzed. Some days I’m driven and find it easier. On other days I’m not motivated at all, and it feels painful. It’s fine. Observing, instead of running away from painful feelings, is essential, not only to beat Resistance but to know yourself better.\nThe idea of dropping your expectations and just observing is challenging but leaves space for something more profound: the cold shower disappears, and all you are doing is practicing meditation.\nIn practicing meditation, we’re not trying to live up to some kind of ideal—quite the opposite. We’re just being with our experience, whatever it is. If our experience is that sometimes we have some kind of perspective, and sometimes we have none, then that’s our experience. If sometimes we can approach what scares us, and sometimes we absolutely can’t, then that’s our experience.\nThis very moment is the perfect teacher, and it’s always with usis really a most profound instruction. Just seeing what’s going on—that’s the teaching right there. We can be with what’s happening and not dissociate. Awakeness is found in our pleasure and our pain, our confusion and our wisdom, available in each moment of our weird, unfathomable, ordinary everyday lives.\nHow we regard what arises in meditation is training for how we regard whatever arises in the rest of our lives.\nPema Chödron, When Things Fall Apart\n",
