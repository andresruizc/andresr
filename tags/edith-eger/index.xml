      <description>Edith Eger is a hero of mine. She was born in 1927 and grew up in Nazi-occupied Europe. When she was sixteen, Edith and her family were sent to Auschwitz. She and her sister Magda survived, but their parents and nearly everyone she loved did not. When the Nazi concentration camps were liberated, she was discovered under a pile of dead bodies. Edith weighed 32kg, was severely malnourished, and had a broken back, pneumonia, and typhoid fever, among others.</description>

      <description>When I started university, I met a girl. She was funny, pretty, and kind, and I completely fell in love with her. It was an amazing feeling. The problem was that I was very shy and introverted, and sometimes connecting with others wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have confidence in myself, and I was the only one who seemed to have this issue, I assumed that something was wrong with me.</description>
