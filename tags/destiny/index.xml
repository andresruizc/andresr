      <description>SPOILER ALERT: This blogpost is based on the book Lessons In Chemistry.
When Elizabeth Zoth was ten, she didn&amp;rsquo;t have friends and felt alone. But John, her older brother, was always there. He was kind and protective and taught her to read and write. One day, John committed suicide. She was broken. When Elizabeth decided to study chemistry and become a scientist, she was mocked. It was in the 50s, and women were not considered &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; enough.</description>
