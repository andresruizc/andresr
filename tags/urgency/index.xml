      <description>We all have ambitions: to write a book, run a marathon or travel to an exotic destination. These are good activities that we would like to do, but there is a problem.
We know we should act, but we find it difficult to do so. It is as if there is an invisible barrier preventing us from moving forward. We are tired, we make excuses, or we doubt ourselves. And that&amp;rsquo;s a shame, because part of what we achieve in our lives will be due to our actions, not our unfulfilled desires.</description>
