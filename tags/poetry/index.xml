      <description>This is a excerpt from the graduation speech that John Roberts, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, delivered at his son&amp;rsquo;s high school in Cardigan on 3 June 2017:
From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice.
I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty.</description>

      <description>You who are passing by
I beg you
Do something
Learn a dance step
Something to justify your existence
Something that gives you the right
To be dressed in your skin in your body
Learn to walk and to laugh
Because it would be too senseless
After all
For many to have died
While you live
Doing nothing with your life
Auschwitz survivor Charlotte</description>
