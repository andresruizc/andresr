[{"content":"SPOILER ALERT: This blogpost is based on the book Lessons In Chemistry and contains spoilers.\nElizabeth Zott hated being in class, sitting at a desk, listening to monotonous teachers talking about boring subjects. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that she didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy learning. She loved it. But all learning there was based on memorization, and Elizabeth liked creativity. Elizabeth also disliked her classmates, with whom they shared no hobbies. And all that made her suffer. A lot. She was a ten-year-old girl, and everything was supposed to be fun. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. She hated school, had no friends, and never had the feeling of fitting in.\nThe nightmare didn\u0026rsquo;t end when school was over and she came back home. Her parents, especially her father, were not nice to Elizabeth. But there was always a glimmer of hope: her older brother John. John represented the opposite of what she didn’t like about her life. John was always there, always kind and protective and encouraging Elizabeth to question things and learn by oneself.\nTheir relationship was amazing, and as they spent more time together, grew stronger and stronger. Elizabeth had the feeling that everything could go terrible, but if John was by her side, things would somehow work out well. And then everything changed.\nElizabeth\u0026rsquo;s father was extremely intolerant of people who were different from him, and when he found out that his son John was gay, he harassed him. For him, having a gay son was a disgrace, and therefore decided to make his life impossible. Since then, John felt imprisoned, as if there came a day when John decided it was time to put an end to it. He committed suicide. When Elizabeth found out, she was alone and devastated. She felt hopeless, convinced there was nothing she could do to improve her life, and all she could see was darkness.\nA couple of years laters, as he approached her entry into university, she realized she liked science because it provided her certainties. And more specifically, chemistry. Atoms and chemical reactions were easier to understand than people. But it was in the 50s, and women were not considered good enough. Women were, mostly, homeworkers and secretaries, and not scientists, engineers, or pilots.\nShe graduated with honors with a bachelor\u0026rsquo;s and master\u0026rsquo;s degree, and decided to pursue a Ph.D. But soon after starting, her tutor tried to sexually abuse her, and since the professor was very influential and the women were treated unfairly, there was not even a trial. Elizabeth was forced to leave her university, dropping out from her PhD. She looked for different PhD programs but found none. The only way for her to do science was to join an institute that offered an assistant job called Hastings, in which she would work in a lab together with scientists.\nThe conditions were far from ideal. She was not treated well at her new job and had to fight for everything, but at least people let her work on science, her passion. One day, while eating lunch at the cafeteria, she met Calvin Harris, one of the most acclaimed scientists in the world. Both quickly became friends. Harris, who also had a terrible childhood, was intelligent and kind. He always supported Elizabeth, like her older brother John. They spent much time together, sharing many ideas and collaborating on research projects. It was the first time she felt deeply understood in a very long time. Both quickly fell in love. She was happy. But one day, everything changed.\nHarris died in an accident, leaving her alone and devastated. Hastings removed everything related to Harris’, including his lab team and funding. And since Elizabeth depended on Harris, she was fired. Elizabeth tried to unsuccessfully find a new job, and as a result money was running out. She discovered she was pregnant and would soon be a single mother. Everything turned dark, but giving up was not in Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s nature. Her daughter, Mad, and her love for chemistry would save her. And also cooking, which she was always interested in because she believed it was the same as chemistry. With no job and with a lot of free time, she did what different and innovative people do: to combine unrelated ideas in unexpected and never seen ways, giving rise to original creations. Using unexplored techniques together with her in depth knowledge in chemistry, she created new recipes never seen before.\nAfter catching the attention of a friend of hers, who worked as TV director, Elizabethwas offered to host a cooking show: Supper at six. She would cook one meal daily and discuss the importance of eating healthily, with potentially millions of people watching. Elizabeth didn\u0026rsquo;t like the idea but needed money, so she accepted. When she was in school, nobody knew her. Now, things were different. At first, the show was not going well and was close to getting canceled. But people started loving the originality of Elizabeth, whose recipes and analogies between chemistry and cooking blew the audience\u0026rsquo;s minds.\nAgainst all odds, the show became a national success, and Elizabeth was deeply admired. However, after several successful years, Elizabeth decided to cancel the show, because she never intended to be a national TV star. All she wanted was to do science, her true passion. Elizabeth would occasionally send encouraging messages to the audience, and on the last day of the show, she sent a special one, especially dedicated to all women across the country:\nWhenever you start doubting yourself or feeling afraid, just remember. Courage is the root of change, and change is what we\u0026rsquo;re chemically designed to do. So when you wake up tomorrow, make this pledge. No more holding yourself back. No more subscribing to other\u0026rsquo;s opinions of what you can and cannot achieve. And no more allowing anyone to pigeonhole you into useless categories of sex, race, economic status, and religion. Do not allow your talents to lie dormant, ladies. Design your own future. When you go home today, ask yourself what you will change. And then get started.\nWhen we feel inspired by someone, it is not because of what they do or how they do it. It\u0026rsquo;s because of why they do it. Elizabeth was excellent at cooking and used innovative techniques, but the most important thing was the principles and values she embodied. She didn\u0026rsquo;t accept the status quo, rejecting and challenging all preconceived notions about what women could do. Elizabeth believed that there is hidden potential inside every person, and she used cooking to help people discover how to unleash it. Elizabeth experienced many setbacks throughout her life but didn\u0026rsquo;t get stuck in the past. That\u0026rsquo;s what all her audience saw, making Elizabeth so admired. She knew it was not what happens to you that matters but your reaction to these experiences. That means the key is your willingness to embrace and adopt change and get started, no matter what.\n\u0026ldquo;Design your own future. When you go home today, ask yourself what you will change. And then get started.\u0026rdquo; ~Elizabett Zoth, Lessons in Chemistry.\n","permalink":"https://andresruizc.github.io/andresr/posts/create_future/","summary":"SPOILER ALERT: This blogpost is based on the book Lessons In Chemistry and contains spoilers.\nElizabeth Zott hated being in class, sitting at a desk, listening to monotonous teachers talking about boring subjects.

Para poder asistir a uno de sus mítines, eligió desplazarse en un pequeño avión de hélice. Cogió asiento y, como de costumbre, empezó a leer el periódico tranquilamente. Era un viaje rutinario, así que Mike, su guardaespaldas, se tumbó a descansar.\nSin embargo, a mitad de trayecto, Nelson levantó la cabeza y se dio cuenta de que una de las hélices del avión no funcionaba. El avión era muy pequeño, y cualquier problema podía comprometer la seguridad. Había razones para preocuparse. Previamente en la campaña electoral, Mandela había sido amenazado de muerte en varias ocasiones. ¿Era el fallo de la hélice un error mecánico, o se trataba de un atentado? Mandela dejó pausadamente el periódico y se lo comentó a Mike, quien se incorporó alarmado y se apresuró hacia la cabina, donde se encontraban los dos pilotos. Tras una breve conversación, Mike, algo nervioso, inmediatamente fue a avisar a Mandela.\n“Vamos a realizar un aterrizaje de emergencia”, le dijo a éste, “lo más probable es que todo salga bien.” Lo más probable. A pesar de ello, Mandela levantó la mirada, sonrió, y siguió leyendo el periódico como si nada. Mike había realizado decenas de viajes en ese avión, y nunca hubo ningún problema. Ahora había una hélice rota, y un accidente mortal era probable. Mientras él temblaba de miedo, Mandela, irradiaba una tranquilidad pasmosa.\nPoco después, se acercaba el momento decisivo. A través de la ventanilla se vislumbraba la pista de aterrizaje, y cada vez había más turbulencias. Mike, casi en estado de pánico, no se atrevía a mirar, así que decidió cerrar los ojos. Pero antes, giró rapidamente la cabeza para mirar a Mandela. Lo que vio le sorprendió enormemente. Mandela seguía leyendo el periódico como si nada. En el aeropuerto les esperaba el periodista estadounidense y coautor de la futura autobiografía de Mandela, Richard Stengel. A Stengel le comunicaron que la llegada del pequeño avión podría retrasarse debido a un problema, y más tarde presenció en directo como el avión aterrizaba dando tumbos. Stengel, que era consciente de que el avión tuvo problemas, se acercó a Mike para preguntarle sobre el viaje.\nAl contarle este la historia, Stengel sentía curiosidad. Quería comprender por qué Mandela actuó de esa forma, así que Stengel le preguntó a Mandela en el coche de camino al mitin. Su respuesta le pilló por sorpresa. Tal y como recuerda, Mandela “se me acercó, abrió los ojos de par en par y con voz dramática me dijo: !Créeme, estaba muerto de miedo ahí arriba!”\nMandela estaba muerto de miedo. Tanto como Mike, incluso más. Pero, a diferencia de su guardaespaldas, no dejó que el miedo le dominase. Él sabía cómo controlar sus emociones. Lo normal es reaccionar como Mike, su guardaespaldas. Las cosas no salen bien, y ante la opción de fracasar, uno pierde la cabeza. Es razonable, pero pensándolo de forma racional, ¿de qué servía ese miedo? Si no podemos cambiar la situación en la que nos encontramos, ¿por qué perder la cabeza?\nAnte la posibilidad de morir en un aterrizaje de avión, reaccionar como Mandela requiere de una capacidad de autocontrol al alcance de muy pocos. ¿Qué fue lo ayudó a Mandela a ser así?\nNelson Mandela tuvo muchos maestros, y uno de los más importantes fue la cárcel. Al entrar en prisión, era un joven activista conocido por su forma de actuar impaciente y acelerada. Cuando se empeñaba en cambiar algo que repugnaba siempre actuaba de forma contundente y apresurada, muchas veces sin pensar en las consecuencias de sus acciones. Era impaciente, y eso le trajo muchos problemas.\nAl salir de prisión, Mandela era una persona completamente diferente. 27 años en la cárcel dan para mucho. Aprendió la paciencia, la disciplina y el autocontrol. Y quizás más importante y relevante para nuestra historia, Mandela aprendió a manejar y controlar sus propias emociones. En su aislada y particular celda de un metro por un metro, y sin muchas distracciones, Mandela seguro que reflexionó sobre todas aquellas ocasiones en las que no controlar sus emociones le había jugado una mala pasada.\nMuchas de esas emociones, se dio cuenta, eran destructivas. Incluso si tus intenciones eran las correctas, podrías acabar perjudicado si dejabas que las emociones te dominasen. Ni siquiera hacía falta irse al pasado para darse cuenta de ello; ocurría día a día en la cárcel. Aquellos presos que no eran capaces de aguantar los insultos racistas de los guardias y recibían palizas. Los que en un debate gritaban y entraban en cólera por no comprender el punto de vista contrario perdían el respeto de los demás. Para disuadir a ese tipo de personas sólo era necesario apelar a su parte emocional, y eso les hacía débiles y manipulables.\nCuando uno se enfrenta a una situación complicada, la primera reacción suele ser muy emocional. La mayoría de las veces esa reacción suele estar basada en el miedo, ya que desconocemos lo que pasará a continuación. En ese justo instante, dejarse llevar puede parecer lo más adecuado, ya que nos ayuda a desahogarnos y reducir el sufrimiento. Creemos que estamos haciendo lo correcto. Pero nada más lejos de la realidad. La mayoría de las emociones, como la ira y el enfado, pueden llegar a ser muy destructivas, y, si no las controlamos, es muy probable que acabemos actuando de forma que luego nos arrepintamos.\nOtra lección que aprendió Mandela en la cárcel es a aprender a largo plazo. En la cárcel, muchos de los presos más jóvenes criticaban a Mandela por no actuar con suficiente rapidez ante las autoridades. Mandela siempre respondía, “Quizás tengáis razón unos días, semanas, meses y años, pero, a la larga, conseguiréis algo más valioso si adoptáis una perspectiva más amplia.”\nEse pensamiento a largo plazo le permitió adoptar una visión más estratégica, lo que a su vez le ayudó a mejorar el manejo de sus propias emociones. Si dejarse llevar por la ira o perder los nervios ante una situación compleja no contribuía a conseguir su objetivo a la larga, entonces no tenía sentido. Saber cómo regular sus propias emociones acabaría siendo decisivo.\nEl objetivo por el que Nelson Mandela trabajó toda su vida era derrocar al apartheid e instaurar un sistema democrático en Sudáfrica. La gran mayoría de la gente, incluidas personas afines a Mandela, lo consideraba extremadamente difícil. Casi imposible. Y la verdad es que tenían sus razones: el racismo, el colonialismo, o los prejuicios, entre otros. La montaña era demasiado grande.\nMandela era consciente de esos desafíos y reconocía que esos problemas no desaparecerían de la noche a la mañana. Al fin y al cabo, el racismo se había gestado durante milenios y el colonialismo durante siglos. Pero Mandela también sabía del poder de pensar a largo plazo. Pequeñas acciones, realizadas durante un largo periodo, pueden dar lugar a cambios extraordinarios. Había estudiado ferozmente historia en la cárcel, y conocía cómo hubo grandes cambios en el pasado. También había leído sobre la cultura china, y se había impregnado del conocimiento estratégico de Lao Tse. Mandela conocía uno de sus pensamientos más famosos, “un viaje de 10,000 pasos comienza con uno.”\nPara Mandela, presentarse a las primeras elecciones democráticas de Sudáfrica iba a ser un camino lleno de obstáculos. No solo tenía que luchar contra el apartheid, el racismo, o los prejuicios.\nTambién sería tratado de forma injusta. Le insultaron, le menospreciaron, y usarían cualquier excusa, por pequeña que fuese, para desacreditarle. No había margen de error. Controlar sus emociones no era un lujo, sino una necesidad. La posibilidad de un futuro democrático en Sudáfrica dependía de ello. Mandela triunfó, y acabaría convirtiéndose en presidente en 1994, cerrando así la brecha entre blancos y negros en Sudáfrica. Consiguió algo que era considerado por muchos como imposible, y una de las claves fue su enorme capacidad para manejar sus propias emociones.\nLa importancia de controlar las emociones es algo que Arthur Ashe también comprendió. Ashe empezó a jugar al tenis desde muy joven, y su talento se hizo evidente al instante. El problema es que, en la década de 1950 y 1960 en EE. UU, ser una persona de color no era nada fácil. Y más si eras un joven de color que destacaba por su innato talento tenístico y era una de las mayores promesas de aquella época.\nAshe estaba decidido a ser tenista profesional, pero era evidente que el camino estaría lleno de obstáculos. Debido a la segregación racial, Ashe fue, especialmente en sus inicios, tratado injustamente. Cualquier pequeño fallo en su conducta podía volverse en su contra. Celebrar los puntos o victorias de forma muy efusiva podía ser mal visto. Como jugaba contra rivales blancos, a menudo los árbitros favorecían a su oponente. De hecho, muchas veces Ashe seguía jugando aquellas bolas que habían salido por unos pocos centímetros, por si acaso los árbitros no las cantaban como mala.\nAdemás, a no ser que una decisión arbitral fuese claramente errónea, Ashe prefería no apelar. A lo largo de su carrera experimentó situaciones muy injustas, y Ashe era el primero en reconocerlo. Pero después de tantos años, Ashe se dio cuenta de que uno no siempre puede controlar cómo actúan los demás. Pero podía elegir cómo reaccionar. Como decía Viktor Frankl, psicólogo y superviviente del campo de concentración nazi de Auschwitz, “entre el estímulo y la respuesta, hay un espacio. En ese espacio esta la libertad de cada uno.” O lo que es lo mismo, si quieres elegir tu respuesta, tienes que ser capaz de manejar tus emociones. Es equivalente a agrandar el espacio al que Viktor Frankl se refería.\nSi un árbitro trataba de forma injusta a Ashe solo por su color de piel, Ashe podía sentir ira y encararse con él. O también podía sentir ira, controlar esa emoción, y canalizar esa energía en algo valioso para él: jugar mejor al tenis. La diferencia entre ambos escenarios no es más que la capacidad de uno mismo de controlar sus emociones.Y así fue. Dentro de la pista, Ashe acabó siendo conocido por su calma, quietud y habilidad para jugar al máximo nivel ante la adversidad. Se suele decir del tenis que es un deporte extremadamente mental, y Ashe tuvo que llevar esa idea al extremo. Su lema, físicamente suelto, pero mentalmente firme, lo resume a la perfección.\nTodas esas adversidades y presión añadida seguramente hubiesen acabado con cualquiera, pero Ashe era diferente. Él sabía manejar sus emociones, exactamente igual que Nelson Mandela. En 1975 ganó Wimbledon contra Jimmy Connors, convirtiéndose así en el primer afroamericano en conseguirlo. Ese mismo año se convertiría en número uno del mundo. Parte de su secreto: la capacidad de gestionar sus propias emociones.\nY es que hay ocasiones en las que no perder los nervios puede marcar la diferencia entre la vida y la muerte.\nLas caminatas espaciales son uno de los momentos más icónicos para los astronautas. En el vasto y oscuro espacio exterior, lo único que separa al astronauta de la inmensidad del universo es su traje y visera, que se encuentra unido a la nave espacial por una pequeña atadura. Son impresionantes, pero no se realizan por placer. Tienen un claro propósito: resolver problemas. Por ejemplo, una reparación de emergencia o alguna tarea de mantenimiento en la estación espacial. Además, son consideradas por los astronautas como una de las operaciones más peligrosas, incluso más que el despegue y el aterrizaje del cohete. El margen de error es casi inexistente. Hay un millón de cosas que pueden salir mal.\nY Chris Hadfield, astronauta de la NASA y comandante de la ISS, estaba a punto de experimentar en su propia piel el papel del riesgo. Por aquel entonces, para mantener los visores libres de vaho, los astronautas usaban una mezcla de aceite y jabón. En una de sus caminatas espaciales, Hadfield tuvo la mala suerte de que parte de esa solución le entró en un ojo. Según recuerda, sintió un gran dolor y empezó a lagrimear. Debido a la ingravidez, esas lágrimas se expandieron por el interior de la visera, y acabaron entrando en su otro ojo. Hadfield se quedó completamente ciego. En medio de una complicada misión, unido por única atadura a una enorme nave espacial, que viaja a una velocidad de 27.000 km/h, y flotando en el oscuro y vasto espacio exterior, Hadfield no podía ver. Su vida corría peligro.\nConvertirse en astronauta es casi imposible. Es algo al alcance de muy pocos, en parte debido a las exigentes cualidades que un astronauta debe poseer. De todas ellas, hay una que llama especialmente la atención. El proceso de toma de decisiones. De hecho, según Hadfield, un astronauta es aquel que “es capaz de tomar buenas decisiones rápidamente, con información incompleta, cuando las consecuencias son realmente importantes.”\n¿Y cuál es uno de los mayores obstáculos a la hora de tomar buenas decisiones? No saber controlar tus emociones. Los astronautas deben ser capaces de no entrar en pánico, aunque la situación sea alarmante. Si estando bajo presión pierdes los nervios, la posibilidad de cometer errores es mucho mayor.\nEs por ello por lo que la NASA prepara simulaciones de todo tipo para formar a los astronautas. Idean complejos y elaborados escenarios como una explosión, un fallo informático, o algún problema mecánico. Los astronautas deben enfrentarse a estas simulaciones e intentar resolver cualquier problema. Después revisan sus acciones y las analizan detalladamente. Anotan sus fallos y aprenden de ellos. Después de repetir este proceso durante muchas más simulaciones, los astronautas se vuelven más y más competentes. Lo único que una simulación no es la vida real.\n\u0026ldquo;Si estás fuera en una caminata espacial y te quedas ciego\u0026rdquo;, dijo Hadfield, \u0026ldquo;te sentirías nervioso y preocupado. Sin embargo, debido al intenso entrenamiento, nuestra reacción natural de pánico no se produce aunque estés cegado.” Todas esas simulaciones de la NASA no solo le sirvieron para ser más competente como astronauta, sino que también le hicieron más fuerte emocionalmente. Enfrentarse continuamente a situaciones peligrosas le ayudó a aprender a manejar el miedo, y a no dejar que le controlase. Entrar en pánico no mejoraría el problema, así que Hadfield mantuvo la calma. En aquel momento seguro que se acordó de una frase que precisamente él mismo dijo años atrás, “no hay problema tan grave que no se pueda empeorar.”\nTras quedarse momentáneamente ciego, Hadfield comunicó el problema tanto a la tripulación como al equipo de tierra. Confiaban en sus capacidades, así que le dejaron seguir trabajando. Tras unos largos e intensos minutos, Hadfield dejó de lagrimear y recuperó la vista. La caminata espacial fue un éxito, y en parte se debe a la capacidad de Hadfield de no perder la calma ante situaciones de pánico.\n","permalink":"https://andresruizc.github.io/andresr/posts/a-largo-plazo/","summary":"Era 1994, y Nelson Mandela se encontraba en plena campaña electoral que le convertiría en presidente de Sudáfrica.

They survived the most lethal Nazi concentration and extermination camp, where nearly one million people died. But they were not free. Not yet. When Nazi Germany was on the verge of defeat, the SS organized “death marches”, forced evacuations of concentration camps over long distances under guard and extremely harsh conditions.\nEdith and Magda were moved to other concentration camps like Mauthausen, where prisoners were made to hack and carry granite to construct Hitler\u0026rsquo;s desired new capital for Germany. Mauthausen was also known for the Stairs of Death, where prisoners were forced to climb 186 with 110-pound granite blocks on their backs. Here, Edith came very close to death.\nAfter Mauthausen came another concentration camp, Gunskirchen. It was less fearsome than Auschwitz or Mauthausen because it was not an extermination camp, and there were no crematoria or Stairs of Death, but prisoners there were on the brink of collapse. The many years of war, the inhuman conditions under which they were held in the concentration camps, and the brutality of the death marches began to take its toll. It was just too much. They were almost living corpses, and it was just a matter of time before they would die.\nIn Gunskirchen, things started to get very ugly for Edith. She couldn’t do it anymore. Knowing that the end was near, she lay down on one of the many piles of corpses and waited for the end. But then something remarkable happened.\nThe Americans liberated the camp, and a soldier, almost by chance, found Edith half-dead among the pile of corpses. Edith was rescued and taken safely along with the rest of the survivors. The moment Edith had been waiting for since she entered Auschwitz almost one year ago had come. Freedom. She was free. And on top of that, her sister Magda also survived! Both were free.\nHowever, their situation was far from ideal. When Edith and her sister were liberated, almost everyone they knew and loved had died. Both were starving and severely malnourished. Edith later discovered that, due to physical abuse, her back was broken. She had tiffus, pneumonia, and pleuritis. The shock had been so great that she even had to relearn how to write and read. Only seventeen years old, she and her sister had lived through one of the greatest atrocities in human history. Edith was free, but healing would take much longer.\nAnd now what? In a recent podcast interview, Edith was asked about Auschwitz. She said, “Auschwitz was an opportunity for an opportunity. An opportunity to discover the power within me, that no Nazi could ever take away from me.”\nThat’s quite profound. Part of the admiration that I feel for Edith comes from the fact that she went from experiencing such terrible things to seeing Auschwitz, almost 80 years later, as an opportunity to improve as a human being. I want to understand what it takes to get to that level of wisdom, and that’s why I recently wrote about Edith’s insights about the power of choice and the difference between victimhood and victimization. In this blog post, I will discuss one idea critical to understanding Edith’s healing.\nSurvivors don’t have time to ask, Why me? For survivors, the only relevant question is What now?\nIt doesn’t matter if you are a survivor; this question affects you because it is about the difference between living stuck in the past or focusing on the present and future. This distinction is crucial because it will define the type of person you become and what you get out of life.\nAs Edith says in her book The Gift, “We ask \u0026lsquo;Why?\u0026rsquo; over and over, believing that if we could figure out the reason, the pain would lessen. Why did I get cancer? Why did I lose my job? Why did my partner have an affair? We search for answers, for understanding, as if there’s a logical reason to explain why things happened the way they did. But when we ask why, we’re stuck searching for someone or something to blame—including ourselves.”\nWe all have experienced at some point something that sucks, and we all have regrets and could name a few things we would do differently today. Sometimes, it’s gone too far, and we feel like we need time to process these negative experiences, and that’s fine. But don’t take too much time because being stuck in the past wishing things to be different doesn’t help. There is a Buddhist parable that goes as follows:\nSuppose a man is struck by a poisoned arrow and the doctor wishes to take out the arrow immediately. Suppose the man does not want the arrow removed until he knows who shot it, his age, his parents, and why he shot it. What would happen? If he were to wait until all these questions had been answered, the man might die first.\nThat’s what happens when we get stuck in the past asking, “Why me?”. This short story perfectly illustrates the consequences of being stuck in the past and how pointless it is to care for things that don’t matter.\nThink again about Edith. With all she had to go through, she could have let hate or fear consume her, or she could have been stuck in the past, blaming Hitler for all the problems in her life. And it would be understandable, but she did the opposite: she realized the past can’t be changed and that sometimes there is only one thing you can do: focus on the present moment and look ahead.\nAs she says in her book The Gift, “When I ask, \u0026lsquo;What now?\u0026rsquo; instead of \u0026lsquo;Why me?\u0026rsquo; I stop focusing on why this bad thing happened—or is happening—and start paying attention to what I can do with my experience.”\nThat’s one of the reasons why she’s so inspiring, and I believe Edith is the standard for how anyone should recover from hardship. Pause for a moment and reflect on how far you could get if you started paying attention to the present moment instead of wasting time and energy on the past. If instead of trying to change what can’t be changed, you focus on what can be done to improve the situation at hand. I would say you could achieve things you now consider impossible.\nDo you know Amelia Earhart? She had the dream of becoming the first women aviator. But being a woman in the 1920s was not easy, especially if you wanted to become an aviator. She had to overcome gender stereotypes, financial constraints, and even several flying accidents. She was mocked, denied, and underestimated.\nBut in 1932, after years of defying the odds, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. This was an incredible feat, accomplished only by a select group of people. She went on to broke different world records, becoming a historical figure in aviation. And more importantly, Amelia Earhart became an iconic figure for her determination and courage to push boundaries, her fight for women’s rights and her contributions to humanitarian efforts.\nBut what would Amelia have achieved if she had only focused on complaining about the unfair situation for women at that time? What if she had accepted the roles imposed by society and assumed that women could never fly? What if she had doubted herself?\nShe wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have achieved what she did and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be Amelia Earhart. Imagine how mentally strong a person must be to do what she did. You can\u0026rsquo;t be normal and achieve what she did. When Amelia had to overcome challenges, what do you think she was most likely to say to herself: “Why me?” or “What now?” I think the answer is clear.\nOn the side of her plane Amelia Earhart painted the words, “Always move with your stick forward.” That’s it. Don’t ask why me. Don’t get stuck in the past. Ask what now. Always move with your stick forward.\n","permalink":"https://andresruizc.github.io/andresr/posts/edith_4/","summary":"Edith and her sister Magda achieved what seemed impossible: to get out of Auschwitz alive.

I was wrong.\nWhat happened to Edith opened my eyes to the fact that everything you have could disappear at any moment. I realized I took many things for granted, and I felt regret. What if I lost a loved one, or became terribly ill? Appreciating something only after losing it is terrible, and I felt shame. I needed to learn to appreciate what I had, so I became interested in developing a gratitude practice.\nPracticing gratitude is an ongoing process that requires daily work, but it is worth it. Shortly after arriving at Auschwitz, Edith understood, for the first time in her life, that she had a choice: to pay attention to what she lost or to pay attention to what she still had. Gratitude is also a choice, and I decided to practice gratitude every day. After several years, here\u0026rsquo;s what I learned.\nGratitude has improved my interpersonal relationships, especially with family and friends. That you have them shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be considered as something ordinary, but rather exceptional. Feeling grateful has motivated me to treat them with love and kindness and to try to help them when needed. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be something extraordinary; small details are enough to make a difference. Gratitude has also made spending time with my loved ones, especially family, much more enjoyable and meaningful. And this is priceless.\nIt has also changed my relationship with myself. There are several ways to practice gratitude; one is to visualize losing what you have. I like memento mori, an ancient practice of reflecting on your mortality. It sounds scary, but I believe awareness of death can improve your life.\nFor example, now I\u0026rsquo;m more conscious that my time is limited, so I treat it as a gift. Once you realize how valuable time is, not wasting it becomes easier. Another consequence of memento mori is that I live more with a sense of urgency. Reflecting on your mortality also helps you to distinguish between what is important and not, and living a more fulfilling life is easier when you can focus on what truly matters. And finally, because you always have in mind that your life will end one day, you are more likely to live with more meaning and purpose. As Confucius said, \u0026ldquo;Every man has two lives, and the second starts when he realizes he has just one.\u0026rdquo;\nI like to see my life as a candle that could go out at any moment. I carefully hold it in my hands. It\u0026rsquo;s fragile. And I look at it with amazement. Gratitude has shown me it\u0026rsquo;s a gift. After all, being alive is truly a miracle. One day, the candle will go out, but until then, I want its flame to shine as brightly as possible.\n","permalink":"https://andresruizc.github.io/andresr/posts/edith_3/","summary":"Right after arriving at Auschwitz, Edith and her mother and sister were waiting in the selection line.

She was funny, pretty, and kind, and I completely fell in love with her. It was an amazing feeling. The problem was that I was very shy and introverted, and sometimes connecting with others wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy. Because I didn\u0026rsquo;t have confidence in myself, and I was the only one who seemed to have this issue, I assumed that something was wrong with me.\nAll these insecurities, and the fact that it was the first time I fell in love, made everything difficult. Our conversations were boring and superficial, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the way to get to know her. I wanted, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how. It was frustrating. A time later, I decided to tell her I was in love. She didn\u0026rsquo;t seem interested in me as much as I was in her, but I did it anyway. She said no, and that hurt.\nThis experience worsened my insecurities and led to me rejecting some parts of myself. Several months later, I was reading Edith\u0026rsquo;s book The Choice and found this.\nSuffering is universal. But victimhood is optional. There is a difference between victimization and victimhood. We are all likely to be victimized in some way in the course of our lives. At some point we will suffer some kind of affliction or calamity or abuse, caused by circumstances or people or institutions over which we have little or no control. This is life. And this is victimization. It comes from outside.\nIn contrast, victimhood comes from the inside. No one can make you a victim but you. We become victims not because of what happens to us but when we choose to hold on to our victimization. We develop a victim\u0026rsquo;s mind – a way of thinking and being that is rigid, blaming, pessimistic, stuck in the past, unforgiving, punitive, and without healthy limits or boundaries. We become our own jailors when we choose the confines of the victim\u0026rsquo;s mind.\nHer words about victimization and victimhood helped me understand myself better. I realized that part of my shyness came from caring too much about what others thought about me. That\u0026rsquo;s a victim\u0026rsquo;s mentality. Being hard on myself when I failed at something is also a victim\u0026rsquo;s mentality. Being stuck in the past, wishing that I did things differently, or when I blamed others when things didn\u0026rsquo;t go as I wanted, is also a victim\u0026rsquo;s mentality.\nEdith has another definition for developing a victim\u0026rsquo;s mind, \u0026ldquo;when we put the focus outside of ourselves,when you look outside yourself for someone to blame for your present circumstances, or to determine your purpose, fate, or worth.\u0026rdquo; When that girl rejected me, I thought the main problem was that she didn\u0026rsquo;t love me, but I was wrong. I was putting the focus outside of myself. The desire to love and be loved is human, and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. But I realized that the only place where I was looking for affection and approval was on the outside. The most important relationship is the one you have with yourself, and I completely neglected this. That\u0026rsquo;s what I believe Edith meant when she said that we develop a victim\u0026rsquo;s mind when we place the focus outside of ourselves.\n\u0026ldquo;No one can take away from you what you\u0026rsquo;ve put in your mind.\u0026rdquo; These were the words Edith\u0026rsquo;s mother told her when they arrived at Auschwitz. These were also the words she repeated herself again and again when she needed to find strength under those terrible conditions.\nWhat happened to Edith was unfair and shameful. But in a situation where most people would have broken down, Edith persevered. She was victimized, but she refused to act like a victim. Somehow, she realized she had something that no one could take away from her: to give meaning to her own experience.\nEdith\u0026rsquo;s insights about how to deal with suffering are profound. They made even more sense to me when I discovered the story of the professional boxer Rubin Carter. In 1966, Rubin Carter was wrongly accused of a crime he did not commit, and after a biased trial, Carter was convicted of triple murder. Nineteen years and two trials later, he was released from prison.\nCarter, too, knew the difference between victimization and victimhood. Later in his life, he explained what he thought about his time in prison: \u0026ldquo;Go beyond yourself in these arduous conditions. Don\u0026rsquo;t give in to your captors. Realize this is an opportunity, instead of a tragedy. It\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity because now you don\u0026rsquo;t have […] all the trappings of civility. You have time; you have space on your hands. Use it.\u0026rdquo;\nEdith and Carter\u0026rsquo;s stories show that you may be experiencing something that sucks, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean there is nothing you can do. There is a difference between victimization and victimhood. That no one can make you a victim but you is a powerful idea, one like finding a retreat inside yourself. You are not powerless. You can choose how you respond, and this is always within reach.\n","permalink":"https://andresruizc.github.io/andresr/posts/edith_2/","summary":"When I started university, I met a girl.

She was born in 1927 and grew up in Nazi-occupied Europe. When she was sixteen, Edith and her family were sent to Auschwitz. She and her sister Magda survived, but their parents and nearly everyone she loved did not. When the Nazi concentration camps were liberated, she was discovered under a pile of dead bodies. Edith was severely malnourished, and had a broken back, pneumonia, and typhoid fever, among others. After the war, she moved to the US and earned a degree in psychology. She went on to earn a Ph.D. and became an influential psychologist.\nShe is the author of two books. First, The Choice: Embrace the Possible, a memoir in which she tells her experiences during the Holocaust and how she was able to overcome trauma and find meaning in her life. And second, The Gift: 12 Lessons to Save Your Life. I read Edith\u0026rsquo;s book The Choice when I was nineteen, and it had a profound impact on me. Edith Eger is an inspiration to me. She is someone I deeply admire and who I look up to every day to improve as a human being.\nIn this series of this blog posts, I share some of the most valuable lessons she taught me, and how they have helped me. I write about gratitude, the power of choice, and the difference between victimization and victimhood. There are several more lessons to come, and I will upload them as I write them.\nThis series of articles on my blog is also my attempt to show my admiration and appreciation for her.\nYou have a choice Throughout my teens, I loved playing football, and I was in a club where I would train and compete every week. I have lots of beautiful memories of it, but competing was not easy. When the stakes were high, I would feel nervous and afraid to make mistakes. Pressure and expectations worsened things, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t perform at my best or enjoy myself. I thought these situations meant something was wrong, and that the solution was to avoid them. But Edith\u0026rsquo;s story showed me the opposite.\nEach moment in Auschwitz was hell on earth. It was also my best classroom. Subjected to loss, torture, starvation, and the constant threat of death, I discovered the tools for survival and freedom that I continue to use every day in my clinical psychology practice as well as in my own life.\nI could focus on what I held in my mind. I could respond, not react. Auschwitz provided the opportunity to discover my inner strength and my power of choice. I learned to rely on parts of myself I would otherwise never have known were there.\nEdith taught me that we always have a choice. She says, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not what happens to us that matters most, it\u0026rsquo;s what we do with our experiences.\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s a choice. I believed that the pressure I felt while playing important matches was an obstacle, but I realized I could choose to see pressure as an opportunity, an indicator that I was doing something difficult and worth it. Instead of running away from it, I could embrace it.\nThis idea doesn\u0026rsquo;t only apply to sports but to life in general. If Edith saw a place like Auschwitz as an opportunity to discover her inner strength, maybe I could also choose to embrace any painful experience. This insight was empowering, but when I was under pressure or paralyzed by fear, the idea that we have a choice was not enough to change my behavior. Going to the places that scare you takes courage, and I lacked something. One of the main reasons why Edith believed she survived Auschwitz was hope, which she defines as \u0026ldquo;the awareness that suffering, however terrible, is temporary; and the curiosity to discover what happens next.\u0026rdquo;\nHope was all I needed. Now, I can choose to see obstacles as opportunities and consider any experience, painful or not, as my teacher. This will cause me to suffer, but meaning and purpose are within reach if I embrace whatever happens without fighting or resisting. That suffering is temporary, and more manageable because it has meaning. I can choose what I hold in my mind, I can choose to approach whatever happens with curiosity, and I can choose that my source of wisdom is the present moment.\nThe foundation of freedom is the power to choose. – Edith Eger\n","permalink":"https://andresruizc.github.io/andresr/posts/edith_1/","summary":"Edith Eger is a hero of mine.

It was inconceivable that a group of people could do that. And they failed, but are not remembered as a failure—quite the opposite.\nJust a couple of months after their departure, Shackleton\u0026rsquo;s trip, the Endurance, became trapped in ice and eventually sank. They spent several months in the harsh Antarctic, isolated from human civilization, trying to survive under extreme conditions with temperatures reaching minus 40º and winds reaching up to 200 km/h. Their food and supplies were limited, forcing them to rely on hunting and foraging. Survival was almost impossible, and the physical and mental strain compounded over time. They also had to deal with the incredibly tough circumstances of the Antarctic Sea, one of the most dangerous on Earth. And these only represent a small portion of the obstacles they overcame.\nDespite all of it, Shackleton and his crew managed to survive. Shackleton\u0026rsquo;s Endurance Voyage is considered one of the most epic survival stories in the history of exploration. Not only that, but their story is also an example of leadership, resilience, accountability, and attitude, among others.\nHere are some ideas that struck me while reading the book Endurance by Alfred Lansing, which tells the story of Shackleton\u0026rsquo;s Endurance Voyage.\nHope After the Endurance sank, everyone felt discouraged because the chances of survival were very low. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop thinking about how the crew would respond, and I asked myself repeatedly: most people in their situation would have given up, why did they keep pushing?\nThat is the same question I asked myself while reading the stories of Viktor Frankl or Edith Eger when they were in Auschwitz. They also endured the impossible, and yet, they survived. In his book Man\u0026rsquo;s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl discussed how hope influenced prisoner\u0026rsquo;s life at the concentration camp.\n\u0026ldquo;The death rate in the week between Christmas, 1944, and New Year\u0026rsquo;s, 1945, increased in camp beyond all previous experience. In his opinion, the explanation for this increase did not lie in the harder working conditions or the deterioration of our food supplies or a change of weather or new epidemics. It was simply that the majority of the prisoners had lived in the naïve hope that they would be home again by Christmas. As the time drew near and there was no encouraging news, the prisoners lost courage and disappointment overcame them. This had a dangerous influence on their powers of resistance, and a great number of them died.\u0026rdquo;\nHope was vital to surviving in the concentration camps. And hope also played an essential role in the survival of Shackleton and his crew because it helped them to keep going despite the extreme circumstances. They were very close to death a couple of times when the weather conditions were terrible or food was lacking, but they always expected things to improve. They never lost hope, which I think partially explains why they survived.\n\u0026ldquo;The quality I look for most is optimism: especially optimism in the face of reverses and apparent defeat. Optimism is true moral courage.\u0026rdquo; – Ernest Shackleton.\nLearn to deal with uncertainty Another thing that struck me was that their survival didn\u0026rsquo;t depend on them. Under these extreme circumstances, there were too many variables outside their control. They would eventually die if they needed food and did not find penguins or killer whales. If the ocean was rough and they didn\u0026rsquo;t find any igloos to take refuge, they would also die. And on and on.\nYet, they persevered. Did they feel overwhelmed or scared? Yes, of course. But they focused on what was under their control and tried to make the best out of every situation. They would not have survived if they hadn\u0026rsquo;t accepted uncertainty.\nHave plans and expect them to fail Not a second went by without them thinking about reaching human civilization. But as with any audacious goal, they needed to break their plan into smaller ones and work on them step by step. Because of the harsh and unpredictable environment they were in, their plans almost always failed.\nShackleton would not waste a single minute complaining. He would immediately create another plan and work on it. It struck me because, in our daily lives, when something doesn\u0026rsquo;t go as expected, we often get stuck in the past, complain, and wish things to be different. If we do that, the plan was probably useless because the unexpected usually happens. As Morgan Housel writes in his book The Psychology of Money, \u0026ldquo;Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan, not going according to the plan.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen a new problem appears, focus on solving it. As Shackleton once said, \u0026ldquo;Difficulties are just things to overcome, after all.\u0026rdquo;\nBe accountable As the head of the crew, Shackleton knew he was responsible for the crew\u0026rsquo;s safety. His decisions could mean the difference between survival and death. The point of view of the rest of the team was indeed considered, but he was the one who had the last word. He knew some of his decisions would be wrong and others would be seen as risky. This could create problems inside the crew, which is a big problem under their circumstances, but he was very good at dealing with people and keeping them motivated.\nLeadership implies accountability, which involves an amount of pressure that very few people can handle. It is mentioned in the book that this pressure affected Shackleton, who seemed to be mentally exhausted. That\u0026rsquo;s why being a leader is a role not everyone wants to assume. But someone needed to do it, and Shackleton did it exceptionally well.\n\u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re a leader, a fellow that other fellows look to, you have to keep going.\u0026rdquo; – Ernest Shackleton.\n","permalink":"https://andresruizc.github.io/andresr/posts/shackleton/","summary":"In 1914, Ernest Shackleton chose one of the most audacious goals at that time: make the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent.

Step out of your comfort zone daily because that will callous your mind. Sounds good, so I researched cold showers and discovered they have been shown to have several benefits, including reduced inflammation, reduced stress levels, boosted energy, increased immunity, and enhanced focus, among others. And because I considered them as self-imposed torture, I decided to take cold showers every morning. Then, everything went differently than planned.\nThe first cold showers were manageable, but after a few days, they were getting progressively hotter and shorter. Mental discomfort increased, and the initial excitement I felt after discovering the benefits of cold showers morphed into self-doubt. My list of excuses to give up piled up, and as usually happens when creating new habits, I was about to quit.\nReaching our limit is not some kind of punishment. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a sign of health that, when we meet the place where we are about to die, we feel fear and trembling. A further sign of health is that we don\u0026rsquo;t become undone by fear and trembling, but we take it as a message that it\u0026rsquo;s time to stop struggling and look directly at what\u0026rsquo;s threatening us. Things like disappointment and anxiety are messengers telling us that we\u0026rsquo;re about to go into unknown territory.\nPema Chödron, When Things Fall Apart\nResistance I would define my experience before the cold shower as a state of agitation that biased me toward inaction through excuses, self-doubt, anxiety, and procrastination. A voice that prevented me from behaving differently, which is not specific to cold showers at all. It also appears when you decide to take on a new challenge but wonder if it is too audacious, when you need to work hard on a project and don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it, or when you consider asking someone out and fear of rejection stops you. So, you\u0026rsquo;d better learn to deal with it.\nSteven Pressfield, author of The War of Art, gives that voice a name: Resistance. He defines it as a force within you that prevents you from showing up as your best self. From working on a personal project. From doing things differently. From taking risks. According to Pressfield, Resistance is your greatest enemy, and the difference between amateurs and professionals in any endeavor boils down to beating it.\nHow it manifests is different for every person. For Pressfield, Resistance is \u0026ldquo;a voice in my head telling me why I can\u0026rsquo;t do something or why I should put it off for another day.\u0026rdquo; For others, it can be procrastination, self-doubt, fear of failure, inaction, ego, excuses, etc.\nAcknowledging the negative consequences of procrastination or fear of failure is an excellent first step, but that knowledge is not enough to beat Resistance. We need something more. We need to encounter that voice every day, and this is where cold showers help. As you may have guessed by now, this is not about cold showers. Cold showers are just a means to meet Resistance.\nOvercoming Resistance When things don\u0026rsquo;t go as expected, keeping the focus outside of yourself is easier. In the beginning, I believed cold showers were the problem. That\u0026rsquo;s Resistance. But after weeks, I decided to change my approach. When Resistance appears before and during the cold shower, it\u0026rsquo;s all about observing. My thoughts, my reactions, and how I deal with the situation. Some days I complain, argue that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, or get paralyzed. Some days I\u0026rsquo;m driven and find it easier. Other days I\u0026rsquo;m not motivated at all, and it feels painful. Why do I behave so differently from one day to another?\nObserving made me realize that it was more about me and my expectations than about cold showers themselves, and that we all have blindspots. Today I woke up and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do it. Resistance told me it was cold and that there was no reason to do it. But I did it and felt good. It turns out I was wrong! Today, what drives me to take a cold shower every morning is curiosity; curiosity to discover how I misunderstand reality.\nWhat started as cold showers became something more profound and interesting. The idea of leaving space for the possibility that you are wrong and trying to observe rather than running away from painful feelings turns out to be the basic idea of meditation.\nIn practicing meditation, we\u0026rsquo;re not trying to live up to some kind of ideal—quite the opposite. We\u0026rsquo;re just being with our experience, whatever it is. If our experience is that sometimes we have some kind of perspective, and sometimes we have none, then that\u0026rsquo;s our experience. If sometimes we can approach what scares us, and sometimes we absolutely can\u0026rsquo;t, then that\u0026rsquo;s our experience.\nThis very moment is the perfect teacher, and it\u0026rsquo;s always with us is really a profound instruction. Just seeing what\u0026rsquo;s going on—that\u0026rsquo;s the teaching right there. We can be with what\u0026rsquo;s happening and not dissociate. Awakeness is found in our pleasure and our pain, our confusion and our wisdom, available in each moment of our weird, unfathomable, ordinary everyday lives.\nHow we regard what arises in meditation is training for how we regard whatever arises in the rest of our lives.\nPema Chödron, When Things Fall Apart\n","permalink":"https://andresruizc.github.io/andresr/posts/cold_showers/","summary":"Do difficult things every day.

As with the most iconic athletes, the principles and values they embody are far more relevant than their achievements. In a speech at the Oxford Union in early 2018, Kipchoge said, \u0026ldquo;I believe in a philosophy that says to win is not important. To be successful is not even important. How to plan and prepare is critical and crucial. When you plan very well, then success can come on your way. Then winning can come on your way.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s natural to feel inspired by him, but how can we prepare and become more competent? It depends on what we want to accomplish, but we can follow some general guidelines. In this post, we will explore the practice of thinking negatively.\nThink negatively In his book, An Astronaut\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Life on Earth, retired NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield explains that one of the best ways to prepare is to practice \u0026ldquo;The power of negative thinking.\u0026rdquo;\nAs he mentions in his book from his training program at NASA, \u0026ldquo;trainers in the space program specialize in devising bad-news scenarios for us to act out, over and over again, in increasingly elaborate simulations. We practice what we\u0026rsquo;ll do if there\u0026rsquo;s engine trouble, a computer meltdown, an explosion.\u0026rdquo; These simulations play a significant role in Chris Hadfield\u0026rsquo;s understanding of competence. He continues, \u0026ldquo;Being forced to confront the prospect of failure head-on-to study it, dissect it, tease apart all its components and consequences- really works. After a few years of doing that pretty much daily, you\u0026rsquo;ve forged the strongest possible armor to defend against fear: hard-won competence.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen the stakes are high, as with space exploration, nothing can be left to chance — every detail matters because the mission\u0026rsquo;s success and the astronaut\u0026rsquo;s survival depends on it — and these simulations made astronauts more competent.\nOne could argue that these simulations are not critical for competence because reality is very complex, and sooner than later, unexpected things happen. If that\u0026rsquo;s the case, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of devising bad news scenarios? The key is to see beyond the simulations themselves. The most interesting lesson was not about learning to deal with a computer meltdown or an explosion (which, by the way, was extremely important because it could be lifesaving) but the learning process that came after that.\nOnce the simulations were carried out, astronauts could analyze their decisions, listen to feedback, and look for areas of improvement. Maybe they performed poorly under pressure, or the crew could have cooperated more efficiently. Or perhaps these simulations made astronauts realize that making good decisions with limited information in a hostile environment is highly complicated. These lessons could be the key to competence; they apply to a specific simulation, and any challenge astronauts may encounter during their future missions. When the unexpected happens, not only in space exploration but also in life, knowing how to thrive under pressure or make good decisions with uncertainty could make a difference.\nThinking negatively also teaches you another critical lesson: the obsession with detail. When simulating bad scenarios, you are constantly looking for potential problems, which can also be considered areas of improvement. This mindset is what it often takes to achieve competence in any endeavor and is what NASA trainers were seeking when making up simulations for astronauts.\nThe practice of negative thinking is not specific to astronauts. For Marcus Aurelius, being a roman emperor was not easy. He faced war, disease, and even a full-scale civil war. In addition, he was surrounded by senators and military members who didn\u0026rsquo;t share his values, didn\u0026rsquo;t want him as emperor, and even wanted him dead.\nIn his Meditations, he tells himself: \u0026ldquo;When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can\u0026rsquo;t tell good from evil … And so, none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative or hate him.\u0026rdquo;\nNothing was more important for Marcus Aurelius than what the stoics call the four virtues: courage, discipline, wisdom, and temperance. In the face of chaos, it is straightforward to be carried away by negative emotions and respond irrationally. By planning his day and recognizing the problematic people he would encounter, he was in a better mindset to react rationally and calmly. He practiced negative visualization not because he was pessimistic but because he wanted to be better prepared for difficult situations.\nThinking negatively: running a marathon Consider a non-experienced runner training for a marathon. Marathons are demanding, both physically and mentally. They require mental toughness, discipline, good physical health, and hours and hours of training. Injuries are one of the most common drawbacks when training for a marathon; no one is immune to them.\nHow can we think negatively to avoid getting an injury? Before starting your training regime, consider the possibility of you getting injured. Assume the usual thing is to get hurt somewhere along the way, not the opposite. And once you have visualized how things could go wrong, act out and try to prevent them. To do so, you could start with the following questions:\n• What are the most common injuries among marathon runners?\n• What are some leading causes of injuries, and how can they be avoided?\n• How can we reduce the probability of getting injured?\n• What will you do if you get injured?\nAnd then, act. Study the most common injuries among marathon runners: shin splints, back pain, stress fractures, or Runner\u0026rsquo;s knee. Second, try to understand why they happen; they may be due to a combination of different factors: improper running technique, lack of body mobility, insufficient muscle mass, inadequate running shoes, or overtraining, among others. Then, work on them one by one:\n• Add strengthening exercises to your routine to become stronger.\n• Add mobility and stretching exercises.\n• Schedule your workouts, leaving time to rest\n• Sleep well and eat healthily.\n• Make sure your running shoes are adequate.\n• Improve your running technique.\nYou may follow these rules and get injured, or not follow them and run a marathon injury-free. Does it mean you wasted your time? Not really. We can never be sure what will happen; some things remain outside our control. If you acted in a way that helped you move in the right direction, it\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nConclusion Sometimes visualizing how things could go wrong is complicated: we may feel fear, lack imagination, or prefer to assume things will always go our way. Don\u0026rsquo;t let all that stop you! The lessons you can learn from visualizing negative scenarios are definitively worth the effort. If astronauts, a roman emperor, or athletes can benefit from devising bad news scenarios and acting out, then the rest of us can. We all have room for improvement, and if there is something we can learn from these examples is that we are only limited by our willingness to improve.\n","permalink":"https://andresruizc.github.io/andresr/posts/think_negatively/","summary":"Feeling ready to do something does not mean feeling certain that you\u0026rsquo;ll succeed, though of course that\u0026rsquo;s what you are hoping to do.

They give us perspective and meaning, an opportunity to find our unique purpose and our strength.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the first time I see that we have a choice: to pay attention to what we\u0026rsquo;ve lost or to pay attention to what we still have.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Survivors don\u0026rsquo;t have time to ask, \u0026lsquo;Why me?\u0026rsquo; For survivors, the only relevant question is, \u0026lsquo;What now?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\n“A good definition of being a victim is when you keep the focus outside yourself, when you look outside yourself for someone to blame for your present circumstances, or to determine your purpose, fate, or worth.”\nSuffering is universal. But victimhood is optional. There is a difference between victimization and victimhood. We are all likely to victimized in some way in the course of our lives. At some point we will suffer some kind of affliction or calamity or abuse, caused by circumstances or people or institutions over which we have little or no control. This is life. And this is victimization. It comes from outside. It\u0026rsquo;s the neighborhood bully, the boss who rages, the spouse who hits, the lover who cheats, the discriminatory law, the accident that lands you in the hospital.\nIn contrast, victimhood comes from the inside. No one can make you a victim but you. We become victims not because of what happens to us but when we choose to hold on to our victimization. We develop a victim\u0026rsquo;s mind \u0026ndash; a way of thinking and being that is rigid, blaming, pessimistic, stuck in the past, unforgiving, punitive, and without healthy limits or boundaries. We become our own jailors when we choose the confines of the victim\u0026rsquo;s mind.\nViktor Frankl “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”\n“When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.”\n“In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.”\n“The one thing you can’t take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me. The last of one’s freedoms is to choose one’s attitude in any given circumstance.”\nMarcus Aurelius “You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”\n“Here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not \u0026lsquo;This is misfortune,\u0026rsquo; but \u0026lsquo;To bear this worthily is good fortune.\u0026rsquo;\u0026quot;\n“If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.”\n“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.”\n“The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”\n“Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?”\n“Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good.”\n“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”\nPema Chödron \u0026ldquo;It’s not a terrible thing that we feel fear when faced with the unknown. It is part of being alive, something we all share. We react against the possibility of loneliness, of death, of not having anything to hold on to. Fear is a natural reaction to moving closer to the truth.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thinking that we can find some lasting pleasure and avoid pain is what in Buddhism is called samsara, a hopeless cycle that goes round and round endlessly and causes us to suffer greatly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The spiritual journey involves going beyond hope and fear, stepping into unknown territory, continually moving forward. The most important aspect of being on the spiritual path may be to just keep moving.\u0026rdquo;\nIn practicing meditation, we’re not trying to live up to some kind of ideal—quite the opposite. We’re just being with our experience, whatever it is. If our experience is that sometimes we have some kind of perspective, and sometimes we have none, then that’s our experience. If sometimes we can approach what scares us, and sometimes we absolutely can’t, then that’s our experience.\nThis very moment is the perfect teacher, and it’s always with us is really a most profound instruction. Just seeing what’s going on—that’s the teaching right there. We can be with what’s happening and not dissociate. Awakeness is found in our pleasure and our pain, our confusion and our wisdom, available in each moment of our weird, unfathomable, ordinary everyday lives.\n\u0026ldquo;The point of meditation is not to try to get rid of thoughts, but rather to see their true nature. Thoughts will run us around in circles if we buy into them, but really they are like dream images. They are like an illusion—not really all that solid. They are, as we say, just thinking.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How we regard what arises in meditation is training for how we regard whatever arises in the rest of our lives.\u0026rdquo;\nEverything that occurs is not only usable and workable but is actually the path itself. We can use everything that happens to us as the means for waking up. We can use everything that occurs—whether it’s our conflicting emotions and thoughts or our seemingly outer situation—to show us where we are asleep and how we can wake up completely, utterly, without reservations.\nThis is a very encouraging teaching, because it says that the source of wisdom is whatever is going to happen to us today. The source of wisdom is whatever is happening to us right at this very instant. If there’s any possibility for enlightenment, it’s right now, not at some future time. Now is the time.\n","permalink":"https://andresruizc.github.io/andresr/quotes/","summary":"Edith Eger \u0026ldquo;Our painful experiences aren\u0026rsquo;t a liability—they\u0026rsquo;re a gift.
